Greetings, child. I am pleased to see that the taint of possession has left you.{^n}{^n}Should you require it, I offer spiritual guidance to the survivors. I will gladly extend this service to you.
Are you the one who stopped me when I was possessed?
My knowledge of spirits has allowed me to devise a trap with which we were able to contain you and the Aetherial that controlled you.{^n}{^n}It was not until the noose was firmly around your neck that the spirit left you though.
Why haven't you dealt with the Reanimator then?
I am afraid that I am not at all fit for combat, which from my understanding was more than necessary for you to reach the reanimator's lair.{^n}{^n}I was only able to subdue the Aetherial within you with the use of a trap, which would have required the reanimator to come to us, just as you have.
You mentioned spiritual guidance?
I understand. I will return should I require your services.
You mentioned spiritual guidance?
I see. I will return should I require your services.
Spiritual guidance?
Troubled memories can cloud the mind and torment the spirit.{^n}{^n}With my guidance, you can move past these painful thoughts and begin anew.

Thank you, I would very much appreciate that.
