Brother Lector
Bring righteous death to our enemies, [[ms]brother[fs]sister].
I shall.
My mace thirsts for heathen skulls. Have you seen any of the foul Order of Death's Vigil out there?
What do you have against the Order?
Their blatant disregard for death disgusts me. They toy with the domain of the gods, thinking themselves above the Divine plan.{^n}{^n}I will see the world rid of their kind so that good men and women may inherit her fertile lands.
Perhaps there is a misunderstanding?
There is no misunderstanding. The necromancers are no better than the Aetherials and Chthonians threatening to wipe us out.{^n}{^n}They would see us burn in damnation.
Then they all must die.
Time will tell on who is right.
A noble goal.
They are about the area, yes.
I'm afraid not.
