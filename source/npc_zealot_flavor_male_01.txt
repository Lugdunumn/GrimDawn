Brother Lector
Bring righteous death to our enemies, [[ms]brother[fs]sister].
I shall.
My mace thirsts for heathen skulls. It is bizarre to find one standing right before me so unconcerned.
I am on your side.
That remains to be seen.{^n}{^n}If it were up to me, you would have been gutted at the door, but for now you are welcome to roam our halls.


What do you have against the Order?
Their blatant disregard for death disgusts me. They toy with the domain of the gods, thinking themselves above the Divine plan.{^n}{^n}I will see the world rid of their kind so that good men and women may inherit her fertile lands.
Perhaps there is a misunderstanding?
There is no misunderstanding. The necromancers are no better than the Aetherials and Chthonians threatening to wipe us out.{^n}{^n}They would see us burn in damnation.

Time will tell on who is right.

I see.
Not going to argue with you.
My mace thirsts for heathen skulls. Have you seen any of the foul Order of Death's Vigil out there?

Then they all must die.

A noble goal.
They are about the area, yes.
I'm afraid not.
