Ulgrim
Move along, my blades hunger for troll blood, but they'll settle for you.
Alright, I'm going.
So, how doomed are we?
I've secured the way via riftgate.
Good work. I can't say I enjoyed my first travel by rift but it's certainly better than the alternative.
I'll see you all in Homestead. (Open Riftgate)
Now that we come to it, I can't say I'm eager to experience travel by rift. I hope you know what you're doing.
I'll see you all in Homestead. (Open Riftgate)
I hope your journey to Homestead goes well.
Where should I go again?
The old route through the mines is blocked off, courtesy of the Aetherials. You will need to enter the Mountain Deeps nearby and find a way through onto the Prospector's Trail. If you follow it north, you will eventually find Homestead. It's hard to miss.
Alright, I'll be off then.
I'll get you to safety soon.
Well if it isn't my old friend from Devil's Crossing. I had a feeling you'd be making your way through here.
Ulgrim? What are you doing out here?
I haven't been entirely honest with you. I'm not a chef, not by profession anyway, although maybe that would have been a better path...{^n}{^n}As it is, I'm an assassin and former First Blade of the Erulan Emperor. It's a title I've not always been proud to bear as my line of work has not always been virtuous, but I dealt with threats to the empire. Now all of humanity is threatened by foes more deadly than anything we've faced before. It is, however, a time when I can put my talents to a more noble purpose.{^n}{^n}You haven't been entirely forthright with me either, "Taken" but don't worry, I'm the keeper of many secrets.

Why did you join me in Devil's Crossing only to leave again?
My job was to scout the countryside, get bearings on enemy strongholds and investigate weaknesses.{^n}{^n}Your mention of people surviving out in Devil's Crossing was intriguing, so I wanted to see it for myself. Having learned everything I could about the area, I felt it was time to return to my men in Homestead.
Your men?
Can't say I like it any more than they do, but I am working alongside the Black Legion. They are all that remain of the imperium's forces.



Seems you have things covered.



The First Blade of the Emperor?
Look, I'm sure you have many questions, but now is not the time.{^n}{^n}We need to get these people to Homestead.



So how can I help here?
I came upon these refugees on my way through Smuggler's Pass. They were trapped and would soon have become food or entertainment for the trolls. I had to do something. Now we are stuck out here, caught in the midst of a battle between the trolls and the Aetherial forces.{^n}{^n}The tunnel to Homestead is blocked by aetherfire and the only option now is a passage through the Mountain Deeps. It is a foul place at the bottom of the world, infested with all manner terrible things that hate the sun.There is no way these people would survive down there. In Devil's Crossing, I saw that you had the power to open rifts. I need you to fight your way to Homestead, secure a rift and come back for us.{^n}{^n}So please, help these people. Below is an entrance to the Deeps, from there you'll exit onto the Dusty Road and that will lead you into Homestead. Be swift! I'm not sure how much longer I can hold off the trolls before they come in force.
I will find a way to Homestead.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
I've been there. I can take you there via riftgate.


So the 'Taken' has returned. Ready to lend a hand or do you still not 'trust' me?

What's the situation here?
I haven't been entirely honest with you. I'm not a chef, not by profession anyway, although maybe that would have been a better path...{^n}{^n}As it is, I'm an assassin and former First Blade of the Erulan Emperor.

It's not my problem.
So the 'Taken' has returned. Ready to lend a hand after all?

Goodbye.
Well if it isn't my old friend from Devil's Crossing. I had a feeling you'd be making your way through here.
Ulgrim? What are you doing out here?

What did you call me?
A 'Taken'. Well, formerly so if we get down to semantics. The Aetherial left you just before you hanged to death, am I not correct?
How do you know all this?
My sources are quite good, if I say so myself. But you trusted me, and now I shall trust you.



Not sure I can trust you anymore.

How did you know I would come here?
You seem to want to do the right thing by the people of Devil's Crossing. They're going to run out of food soon.{^n}{^n}If I were looking for a new source, I'd head up here too.
What are you doing out here?
Well, we meet again. If you recall, we crossed paths outside of Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}I figured someone would have to come through here eventually. It's no secret the people in Devil's Crossing need food and Homestead is the logical choice.

A 'Taken'. Well, formerly so if we get down to semantics. The Aetherial left you just before you hanged to death, am I not correct?
How do you know all this?
I know that you've left quite a mess back in Cronley's hideout. Not that he didn't deserve it. That man was a twisted bastard that deserved everything he got.{^n}{^n}I also know about your heroics back in Burrwitch. Warden Krieg nearly bested one of the most powerful inquisitors I've ever met, yet you were able to overcome him.{^n}{^n}My sources are very good, if I say so myself.
You sure know a lot about me.
It comes with the trade. But let's worry about that later. Now that you've arrived, perhaps we can finally get out of this little predicament.

I want no part in this.
I know about your heroics back in Burrwitch. Warden Krieg nearly bested one of the most powerful inquisitors I've ever met, yet you were able to overcome him.{^n}{^n}And yet you passed through Arkovia without a second thought of Cronley's activities. Intentional? Will have to ponder that further.{^n}{^n}My sources are very good, if I say so myself.

I know that you've had to battle through beast and Aetherial to get this far, but yet you refuse to face the world's real demons.{^n}{^n}My sources are very good, if I say so myself.

Greetings, 'Taken'. I had a feeling you'd be coming through here sooner or later. You have a knack for going where the killing is thickest.

It comes with the trade. Oh, but where are my manners. My name is Ulgrim, First Blade of the Emperor, at your service.{^n}{^n}Now that you've arrived, perhaps we can finally get out of this little predicament.

The First Blade of the Emperor?
Look, I'm sure you have many questions, but now is not the time.{^n}{^n}We need to get these people to Homestead.

I don't care in the least.

Good luck.
Move along, my blades hunger for troll blood, but they'll settle for you.
Alright, I'm going.
