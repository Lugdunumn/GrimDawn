Bernard
Welcome back to our humble camp. May your road be always safe and the wind ever at your back.
Farewell.
Your allies have served the region well by destroying that barricade.
Farewell.
You've returned. Was your venture successful?
I destroyed the barricade.
A job well done!{^n}{^n}Thank you. You've done good by us, and we won't forget it.
My pleasure.
Hello again! How goes your search for the dynamite?
Where should I be looking again?
I reckon there should be some dynamite lying around Staunton Mine to the west.
Thanks. I will get to it.
Still searching. Goodbye.
Greetings, stranger. A pleasure to meet someone who doesn't begin a meeting with weapons. Can't say the same for the gang up the hill to the east.
You're having trouble with bandits?
Violent and bloodthirsty murderers, all of them. Everything we despise in this world. And now they've set up a barricade along the road to trap travelers such as ourselves. We've set up camp here while we decide what to do.{^n}{^n}The best course of action would be to blow that barricade, allowing our brothers and sisters of the road to travel in peace; however, we lack the means to do so. Say, you look like a capable sort. Let's make a deal. Staunton Mine to the west of here is abandoned, but it may have some explosives. If you recover some dynamite and use it to destroy that wretched blockade, I can offer you some coin for your troubles. What do you say?
Sure, I'll help you out.
I'm not interested.
The blockade is destroyed.
You astound me, stranger.{^n}{^n}Thank you. You've done good by us, and we won't forget it.
Always a pleasure to ruin an outlaw's day.
Farewell.
