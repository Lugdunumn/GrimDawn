Lancel the Knight
Greetings!{^n}{^n}I am Lancel, and I've traveled the world in search of one worthy of my collection.{^n}{^n}Are you such a one?
I am feeling knightly.
As you should!{^n}{^n}But are you in more of a silver mood...or perhaps something a bit more sinister?
The silver armaments!
A fine choice.{^n}{^n}I might say it's my favorite choice!{^n}{^n}Be aware, this is quite the large collection, so make sure your bags have enough space.
(Receive Illusions: Silver Knight)
The black armaments!
Hm, can't say it's what I would go with, but who am I to judge?{^n}{^n}Be aware, this is quite the large collection, so make sure your bags have enough space.
(Receive Illusions: Black Knight)
What was the most impressive thing you've seen?
It was a splendid sight.{^n}{^n}He fought as if he were a ferocious beast. His spear cut through foes in a blur.{^n}{^n}This armor is now all that remains of the venerable warrior.{^n}{^n}Be aware, this is a large collection, so make sure your bags have enough space.
(Receive Illusions: Dragon General)
Have you met any wizards in your travels?
Indeed I have. Powerful beings they are, not to be trifled with.{^n}{^n}Although the one I met was very wise, very ancient...but an enigmatic fellow.{^n}{^n}He told me to fly.{^n}{^n}Be aware, this is a large collection, so make sure your bags have enough space.

I could use a companion.
This is a lonely world, it helps to have a friend.
I'll take the sacred crate.
This creature is a symbol of great fortune in many cultures.{^n}{^n}Treat it well.
(Receive Item: Sacred Crate)
I'm tired of these Illusions.
I understand. Looking this good can become quite the burden.
(Receive Item: Illusion-Be-Gone)
Then start fresh with Illusion-Be-Gone!
True, I already have that.
Um, ok. Goodbye.
