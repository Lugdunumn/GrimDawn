Harvey the Drifter
Leave, yes, leave! They must not see you entering my hideaway!
Ok then.
They killed everyone...everyone but Harvey! Heh heh!{^n}{^n}They'll never find me, they'll never think to look here!{^n}{^n}Right under their rotten noses, yes! Yes!
What are you doing out here all alone?
Hiding, safe! Safe, unlike the others.{^n}{^n}They stayed out in the streets and died. All of them died.{^n}{^n}Now they crawl again, yucky rotting things! But not Harvey!
Devil's Crossing is safe. I can take you there.
No...no, I cannot go. Nowhere is safe but here.{^n}{^n}Harvey is safe. You will not take Harvey away!
Forget it.
You've been here from the beginning?
Harvey was here when the world ended, yes.{^n}{^n}The sun came down and the dead rose instead.
Do you know where the one called the Warden is?
No...no...not that one.{^n}{^n}Lives up the road, on the hill, in the evil house where people scream.{^n}{^n}Always screaming...
Hm, that's actually helpful. Thanks.
What can you tell me about the area?
What? Harvey doesn't leave home much. Except when the rotting ones come.{^n}{^n}Then Harvey hides in the passage under the bridge. Leads to the old Hallowed Hill, but many dead there.
Huh, a hidden passage. Thanks.
What if someone killed the Aetherials?
Well good luck out here.
A survivor? Are you from Burrwitch?
Harvey was here when the world ended, yes.{^n}{^n}The sun came down and the dead rose instead.
What did you do here before the Grim Dawn?
Harvey...had little store along the bay.{^n}{^n}Lived there with a wonderful little girl and beautiful wife.{^n}{^n}But they're gone now. Gone! And you make Harvey remember!
I'm so sorry.



I'm going to make this place safe from the Aetherials.
Well good luck out here.
You're in luck, I'm here to purge the Aetherials.
What? No, no! If you kill, they come back, they search for the living and they find Harvey!{^n}{^n}I'm safe here, they'll never look...{^n}{^n}You'll ruin everything!
Nevermind, I'm sorry!
What do you know about this place?
Dead place, full of rotting ones.{^n}{^n}Harvey hide. Harvey survive.

There's no way you survived out here alone.
Harvey clever and tough.{^n}{^n}He show you...
What? No. That's not what I meant.

I am going to clear out the rotting ones.
I think I'll be going now.
