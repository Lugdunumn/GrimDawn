The Liberation of Malmouth
The Living Factory
Sabotage
The Aetherial Fleshworks infest vast portions of the city of Malmouth, a terrifying sight considering all this was grown from living human flesh. The entrance is nearly impenetrable, but Ulgrim believes if you sabotage the vents spewing out vast amounts of heat and steam across Crown Hill, the Fleshworks will be forced to open or else risk critical failure. Once you have destroyed the vents, head for the entrance to the Aetherial stronghold on the northern end of Crown Hill.

Destroy the Northern Exhaust Vent
Destroy the Eastern Exhaust Vent
Destroy the Southern Exhaust Vent


Slay the Shaper of Flesh
The Fleshworks will not be without defenses and it is unlikely that you'll be able to simply walk into the Sanctum of Flesh and dispatch the monster in charge of all these atrocities. You must figure out a way to unlock the inner factory.{^n}{^n}Once the Sanctum of Flesh is open to you, you must deal with whoever, or whatever, is in charge and rid Malmouth of the Aetherials once and for all.




Slay the Guardians of the Sanctum of Flesh
Slay the Shaper of Flesh
