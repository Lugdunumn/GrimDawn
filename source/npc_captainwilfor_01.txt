Captain Wilfor
I can't believe the Black Legion is actually here.{^n}{^n}Maybe we stand a chance after all. Maybe Malmouth will be free of this infestation.
It's not over yet.
We could use another dependable soul around here.{^n}{^n}I just hope your efforts aren't in vain.
We'll work this out.
It's not over yet.
Get out of my face and do something useful.
Alright, alright.
Well, you weren't lying about the Legion arriving.{^n}{^n}But have you sabotaged the Aetherial efforts in the Candle District?
It is done. The wagons are destroyed.
I had you figured all wrong. The Legion at our doorstep and the wagons destroyed all in one day.{^n}{^n}Here, some iron bits for your efforts. It's the least I could do in return.
Just doing my part.
Well? Have you sabotaged the Aetherial efforts in the Candle District?
It is done. The wagons are destroyed.
Hm, maybe I had you figured all wrong. We could use another dependable soul.{^n}{^n}Here, some iron bits for your efforts.
Just doing my part.
Well, you weren't lying about the Legion arriving.{^n}{^n}But have you sabotaged the Aetherial efforts in the Candle District?
Where are the wagons again?
Their efforts are concentrated on the Candle District. That's where the fighting was thickest near the end.{^n}{^n}Look around the alleys and streets. They won't be hard to miss.
I'll get on it.
I'm still working on it.

I'll get on it.
I have other questions.
I'm still working on it.
If you're serious about heading out into the Candle District, which I don't recommend, then there is something you could do to cement our trust.
Alright, what is it.
The Aetherials do more than just slaughter us, that much is apparent. They've been gathering the dead and transporting them to Crown Hill.{^n}{^n}To what end? Just take a look at the mutated brutes roaming the city. We're just fuel for their experiments, material for their army.{^n}{^n}And I will not stand for another human being used this way. The Aetherial gathering efforts are concentrated around the Candle District, where the fighting was thickest. If you head out there, destroy their despicable Corpse Wagons.
Alright, I will destroy the wagons.
I don't have time for this right now.
I've already sabotaged the wagons.


More important things require my attention.
If you're telling the truth, this could be the first good news we've had in months.{^n}{^n}That's IF you're telling the truth...
Can I ask a question?
What is it?
What's the situation in Malmouth?
I'd say it was bad, but we've gone well beyond that.{^n}{^n}The city is lost, the survivors are trapped between the aetherfire and Aetherial abominations.{^n}{^n}We are all that remains.
I have another question.
Horrible.
I met a Malmouth survivor, Amala.
She survived the aetherfire? That's nothing short of incredible. Then again, I'm not sure how you got here alive either.{^n}{^n}She and a small group foolishly set out a few weeks ago, but we assumed they all perished.
She's the reason we're here.
Remains to be seen if that's a good thing.
I have another question.
Farewell.
She found relative safety down in Devil's Crossing.
It's a small consolation that people survived elsewhere, but if Malmouth is any indication, a fate worse than deaths awaits them all in the end.
You're so cheerful...
I'm just being realistic. We're nothing more than fuel for their hellish creations.{^n}{^n}We've already lost this war. Best we can do is choose where we die and how.
I have another question.
I'll, um, leave you to your thoughts.
It's not over yet.
I have another question.
Farewell.
I have another question.
Farewell.
You mentioned the Fleshworks?
Yes, it's what we're calling the massive fleshy growth that's been expanding out from Crown Hill.{^n}{^n}Prisoners and corpses alike are taken there. Nobody ever leaves.{^n}{^n}What comes out? Fleshwarped horrors beyond imagining.
I have another question.
Disturbing.
We'll deal with it too.

Don't worry, I am.
You better have a damn good reason to be here, before I assume you're just another Aetherial.{^n}{^n}You're not from Malmouth though. I'd know.{^n}{^n}Speak, why are you here?
I've been sent here to help.
Eh? You and what army?{^n}{^n}The city has been overrun, our people scattered, dead or worse, taken into the Fleshworks.

The Black Legion is on its way.
The Black Legion? They survived the carnage in the capital?{^n}{^n}I suppose if anyone was going to pull through, you could count on the emperor's finest. How do they plan to get here?{^n}{^n}The docks are destroyed. Aetherfire surrounds us.
The way is secure. We just need a way inside the city.
I don't know what that means, but if it's true, the best way into the city proper would be through the Candle District.{^n}{^n}The bridge was raised following the attacks, but the controls should still function. If you find a way to lower it, then the Legion can enter.
Sounds like a start.
We'll figure something out.
What is this place?
As far as I know, we are the last pocket of free people in our once grand city.{^n}{^n}Most of us, including myself, are remnants of the city guard. We do our best to survive, mostly by scavenging where the Aetherials are thinnest, but those opportunities are quickly becoming few and far between.


I'll be back.
Actually, I was just leaving.
You better have a damn good reason to be here, before I assume you're just another Aetherial.{^n}{^n}You're not from Malmouth though. I'd know.{^n}{^n}Speak, why are you here?
Just another survivor trying to get by.
Well you picked the wrong place to stumble upon.{^n}{^n}Malmouth has fallen. This is no place for wanderers.
Fair enough.
Actually, I was just leaving.
