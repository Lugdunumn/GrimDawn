*Oliver sighs*{^n}{^n}Don't suppose you've seen my wife, Daila, around. Have you?{^n}{^n}Don't tell me she's run off on another of her stories...
I...think she's run off to Malmouth.
What?!{^n}{^n}But...she...how...I...{^n}{^n}By the gods, that girl will be the death of me.{^n}{^n}If you see her again, please tell her to come home. Malmouth is no place for a young lady to be off on her own, especially now.

I'll let her know.
I think she'll be just fine.
Does this happen often?
Too often, I'd say.{^n}{^n}The world is crumbling around us and the girl's head is in the clouds.{^n}{^n}*Oliver sighs again*{^n}{^n}She doesn't appreciate how much she makes me worry.
I...think she's run off to Malmouth.

Hope she comes home soon then.
Sorry, I haven't.
Either grab a rake or stand aside. This field will take some hard work to get back into shape.
Farewell.
