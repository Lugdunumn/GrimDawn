Beware, traveler. The lands ahead are as foul as they are deadly.{^n}{^n}The stench of wendigo is heavy upon the air.{^n}{^n}Travel safe.
Wendigo?
The vile spirit taints the heart and corrupts the soul.{^n}{^n}None who have given in to its allure remain human for long...

That is concerning.
Where are you headed?
We had thought the way north safer. We are turning back to Wightmire.{^n}{^n}And so should you.

Noted.
Travel safe.
