Bounty: Revenant of Death
Bounty
The Arkovian curse is a horrific display of our master's power, but it also serves as a source of countless curiosities for the Order.{^n}{^n}Deep within the Steps of Torment, there are Revenants that have learned to manipulate death as we have. It is a twisted mockery of Uroboruuk's spell and must be put to an end.{^n}{^n}Anyone who braves the Steps of Torment in order to see this through will be justly rewarded with materials from our stores. The Order shall provide enchantments to assist in the journey.
