Hangman Jarvis
Gods know what your plans are, 'Taken', but I can't deny what you've done up at the Necropolis.{^n}{^n}If you had burnt in the pile with all the rest...well...
I'll consider that an apology, Jarvis.
You're welcome.
Stubborn as ever.
You may have the whole damn place fooled, but I won't fall to your slith tongue, 'Taken'.
What is your problem with me?
My problem? My problem is that you're standing right there instead of burning up in the pile of 'Taken' corpses.{^n}{^n}Now I don't know what game you're playing here, but you're bound to slip up. You can be sure I'll be watching.{^n}{^n}Off with you.
Fine. I'm going.
I think I'll be going.

Killed the Warden, eh? So one bastard killed another. Makes little difference when one survived.
You can't be serious.
Just keeping my good eye on the time bomb in our midst. Go about your way, 'Taken'.
Fine then.
Um, right. I'll be going now.
So Bourbon let you stay? Bah! Man is far too trusting. You'll slip eventually. Don't be going far. My noose is lonely.
Alright then.
So you've cleared out Burial Hill? Didn't just tell your 'Taken' brothers to flee? Heh.{^n}{^n}Best let the Captain know. He could use some good news.
I will speak to the Captain.
The Captain says you're alright, but I've seen what the 'Taken' are capable of. I've got my eye on you.
Very well then.
What're you standing around here for? If you're not gonna make yourself useful, we may as well get another noose ready. {^n}{^n}No sense in keeping around another mouth to feed.
Who am I supposed to talk to again?
You slow or something? Captain Bourbon is up the road, by the stone bridge. Now move!
I'm on my way.
Still drawing breath, I see. You're one lucky bastard, I'll give you that. Best go speak to Captain Bourbon right away. He seems to have a plan for you now that we've spared your life.
What happened... how did I get here?
You were possessed, so we strung you up. Seems the spirit fled your body before your life ran out. {^n}{^n}I'd have left you to hang but the Captain had other plans. He sees some purpose in you and I'm not going to argue.
Where can I find this Captain then?
He's up the road, in the courtyard. Don't make me regret cutting you down.
I'll be on my way then.
It can wait.
