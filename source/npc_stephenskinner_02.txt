I would like to thank you for talking me out of committing the biggest mistake of my life. We were struggling to survive and I got desperate. My family deserves better. Thank you for showing me that hope still remains in this bleak world.{^n}{^n}I would like you to have this. It's a small token of our appreciation. I hope it serves you well.
Thank you. Take care.
Thank you for bringing my family here. We could not ask for more given the times. We will do our best to contribute.
Glad to hear it.
