Mama said you might come back here.{^n}{^n}She needs to speak to you.
And where is your mama?
She said she had some important stuff to do by Malmouth. She said not to tell papa.{^n}{^n}I don't know what a Malmouth is, but it sounds gross.
I found that book and brought it back to your mama.
Good to know. Thanks.
I'll go talk to her then.
I'll go talk to her then.
Hello!{^n}{^n}Mama was talking about you. She said you like to stick your nose in books that aren't yours!
I found it and brought it back to your mama.
Oh! Well that was very nice of you.{^n}{^n}Mama writes in there all the time.
Take care, kid.

Take care, kid.
Well, it was a very important book.
Shh, don't wake her up.
What you got there?
This is Mona. I'd let you hold her, but she's being mean and cries when anybody but me does it.
I understand. You take care of Mona.
Ok, I'll be quiet.
