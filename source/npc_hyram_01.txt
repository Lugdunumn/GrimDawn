Please, you have have to help us. We won't make it out here.
Don't worry, help is on the way. 
Oh, thank the gods you're here.{^n}{^n}You have to get us out. We're in big trouble.
Calm down, I've been looking for you. Captain Wilfor sent me.
He must have told you then, we volunteered, we just wanted to help. {^n}{^n}The resistance needed supplies. I led a group to go scrounging for them. {^n}{^n}I thought I could do it. I thought I could keep them safe, but when we got attacked I panicked and told everyone to run. {^n}{^n}Some of us hid in here but we were split up. I don't know where the other group is.
They're safe. Now you need to get out of here.
Oh, thank the gods.{^n}{^n}I'm ready. Whatever you need to do, just get us out of here.
Off you go. (Open Riftgate)
I'll find them, but for now you need to get out of here.
Alright, alright.{^n}{^n}Whatever you need to do, just get us out of here.
Off you go. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be back for you.
