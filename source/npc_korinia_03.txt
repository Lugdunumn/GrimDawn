Korinia
Don't make me regret this, human.
Can I ask you something?
So long as we're being forward with each other...
Why did you betray the Aetherials?
There are many voices in the Aetherhold and those of us who joined in the invasion of Cairn are but one faction. I may have betrayed the invading force but I would not say I've betrayed all Aetherials. The greatest of our kind exist on a time scale beyond human comprehension and likely are not yet even aware of what has transpired in these last years. I think many voices in the Aetherhold would dissent with this invasion if they could witness the reality of what has come to pass.{^n}{^n}Indeed, things occur so quickly in this material existence, it has been quite difficult to control and cope with the unfolding of events. The unique character, powerful emotions and drives of our human hosts have been an unexpected challenge and your kind has deeply affected all of those Aetherials who came here. Some for the worse, some I hope for the better. I was eager to join those leading the invasion and I still do believe that we Aetherials deserve an opportunity to exist outside the barren confines of the Aetherhold. However, I've felt what it is to be human, to live and feel, to love and experience loss.{^n}{^n}I am fortunate in that my own host, Korinia was of noble spirit and opened my mind to many new possibilities. We have reached an amenable equilibrium that has made us better than our individual selves. We quickly defected from the leadership of the invasion and forged our own path on the side of humanity. We do not oppose all Aetherial kind, but I have come to see that this invasion is ill-conceived and many of those who lead it have paired with the worst of humankind and, converse to Korinia and I, have forged a partnership which is ultimately depraved and evil.{^n}{^n}If the greater Aetherials of the Aetherhold witnessed this corruption, I feel like they would take action to expunge it.
I have another question.
Fascinating.
That's unfair to your host.
You seem...different from Anasteria.
You mean I'm not such a serious bitch all the time?{^n}{^n}I suppose I found the emotions of joy and pleasure more fascinating. I'm particularly fond of the one you call sarcasm, which this host used to in excess.{^n}{^n}You humans manage to all be different, why should all Aetherials be the same?
I have another question.
Fair enough.
I just assumed...
What about the human you possess?
What about her? She's suffered enough injuries during the Grim Dawn that she would have been as good as dead without me.{^n}{^n}If you're insinuating that I abandon this host, then I would kindly tell you to shove it. You don't regain the ability to interact with the physical world and then just give that up.
How did you come to possess her?
She was a loner, not really fitting in with the rest of her troop; most humans don't seem too fond of arcanists.{^n}{^n}I was summoned here by the Master of Flesh prior to the Grim Dawn in order to infiltrate the Malmouth guard. Korinia made an easy target. I was somebody who understood her, who could offer her more than she ever imagined.{^n}{^n}As it turned out, we had more to offer each other than I thought. She opened my eyes to the world of emotions, of humanity; I could not turn on such intriguing creatures after what I experienced.{^n}{^n}When the Grim Dawn started, I rose to stand beside the humans, my old masters be damned.
I have another question.
Fascinating.
That's unfair to your host.
I have another question.
Alright, fine.
I still think it'd be the right thing to do.
Nevermind.
So long as you're on our side.
Farewell.
Do you like what you see?
Um, what do you mean?
Don't play coy with me.{^n}{^n}I can see you staring.
I...gotta go.
Farewell.
