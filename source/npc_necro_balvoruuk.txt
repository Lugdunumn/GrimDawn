Balvoruuk
You have come far within the Order.

Farewell.
Kalderos has informed me of your success within the Steps of Torment. You have banished a malevolent spirit that has haunted those halls for centuries.{^n}{^n}Even in death, Alkamos has tormented the cursed spirits of Arkovia. In his ultimate destruction, you have brought balance to the spirit realm.


It had to be done.
It was a worthy challenge.
I thank you for your assistance back in Old Arkovia. Kalderos spoke fondly of your battle prowess. I think you remind him of his mortal days.
Where is Kalderos now?
He is recuperating beyond the spiritual veil. He will return when he deems it worthy.{^n}{^n}Sometimes Kalderos disappears for months at a time. Where he goes, I could not tell you.
Kalderos does not obey your commands?
Free will, in that respect, Kalderos is no different from you and I.{^n}{^n}He may be bound to the mortal plane as a spirit, but that does not mean he does so at my beckoning.{^n}{^n}More powerful necromancers than I had bound him to his immortal form, but it was done of his own will.
I see.
Farewell.

You're welcome.
Greetings.
What can you tell me about the Order?
We seek to bring a balance to the world and to follow the teachings of our master, Uroboruuk.
Could I speak to Uroboruuk?
Sadly, our master had departed a few years before the Grim Dawn struck. We do not know where he went, or why he left.{^n}{^n}Seeking out the master is a noble goal which many of our members undertake. Unfortunately, none have returned with any hint as to Uroboruuk's location.
I see.
Farewell.
Farewell.
