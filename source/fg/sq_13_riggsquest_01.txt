Paying Debts
Acquire Seals
You owe a debt to Riggs and he's finally ready to get his end of the bargain.{^n}{^n}As you'd expect, Riggs does not have a simple request. He's informed you of a Lost Oasis beyond the Valley of the Chosen, where a powerful artifact known as the Iris of Eternal Night lies hidden.{^n}{^n}However, the ancient Korvan people had sealed it away centuries ago and the key was scattered to the sands. Riggs has knowledge of the first piece, but the texts are profoundly cryptic: so that the darkness of Morgoneth may never know the light of the Eldritch Sun, the way forward has been fed to the devouring sands.{^n}{^n}Riggs has left the rest to you. Acquire the Focusing Iris and your debt will be considered repaid.
