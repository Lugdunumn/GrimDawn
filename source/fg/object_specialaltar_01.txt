Desert Altar
The altar's power is spent.
Step away from the altar.
The altar awaits another.
Step away from the altar.
The altar comes to life at the proximity of a chilling possession.
Activate the altar.
Step away from the altar.
The altar is brimming with the power of the Korvan sun. The veil between realities is thin here.{^n}{^n}Perhaps something chilling could temper its heat and unlock its potential. Something...not of this world...
Step away from the altar.
