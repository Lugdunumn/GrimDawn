Sentinel Thorgil
It seems I may have misjudged you, inquisitor.{^n}{^n}In spite of your vile choice of profession, you have done a great deed for the Three.{^n}{^n}That is a thing to be commended, despite your poor life choices.
I didn't do it for the Witch Gods.
Yes, I suppose you didn't set out with that intention. I suppose you did all this for Cairn, or in the interest of your own survival.{^n}{^n}But in the end, we all serve the Three.
Whatever.
You're welcome.
I can sense it, the task is finished.{^n}{^n}The forgotten god is banished to the darkness of the abyss.{^n}{^n}This is a great time, my friend. I can feel the change in the energy flowing through this place.{^n}{^n}Be well and may the Three be ever at your side.
Thank you.
Be well.
The command has been given. The assault on the temple is underway.{^n}{^n}We draw close to the final hour. An opportunity to correct one's mistakes, to choose the right side once and for all.{^n}{^n}Be strong out there. Do not falter.{^n}{^n}The Three will be with you.

We'll see.
I'll be on my way.

I'll see you out there.
What me? You most certainly will not.{^n}{^n}Though. I'd relish a good fight. It's been far too long.{^n}{^n}I have pledged my life to defend Bysmiel's interests and for now that means standing guard in this camp. Far from the real fight.{^n}{^n}As much a waste as that may be, I will not falter in my duty.
Carry on then.
That's a shame.
And you.
I'll be on my way.
You have chosen wisely stranger.{^n}{^n}This may be a grand opportunity to right the ills you caused in Homestead.{^n}{^n}Help Bysmiel smash the Forgotten God and lay wasted to his feeble minions and perhaps redemption will be yours.{^n}{^n}I do hope you are prepared for a fight, there are many battles ahead of us.
Ills I caused?
Word of your deeds precedes you. {^n}{^n}There are many here in this camp who speak of your...cooperation with the enemy back in Homestead.{^n}{^n}Given your deeds since, I suppose I should give you the benefit of the doubt.{^n}{^n}But you must help us as we lay waste to the Forgotten God and all of those foolish enough to follow him.
That's what I'm here for.
I'll do what needs to be done.

I don't have time for this.
I have nothing to prove.
You have chosen wisely stranger.{^n}{^n}It will be good to have someone like you at our side.{^n}{^n}Together, we will smash the Forgotten God and lay waste to his feeble minions.{^n}{^n}I do hope you are prepared for a fight, there are many battles ahead of us.


I see you've made your choice.{^n}{^n}You may have chosen poorly but none the less it's good to have someone like you fighting for the Three.{^n}{^n}There are many battles ahead of us.
Someone like me?
Yes, of course. Your reputation precedes you.{^n}{^n}The Three are always watching.

I suppose that's good to know.
That's creepy.
Battles ahead of us?
Of course battles...what is it you think we're doing here?{^n}{^n}This isn't some ramshackle band of farmers hoping to survive the end of the world.{^n}{^n}We came here to fight, to put down the Forgotten God and his pitiful minions once and for all.{^n}{^n}I do hope you're prepared to fight.

I'm ready.
I need to leave now.
I heard about the antics you pulled with Kymon's Chosen back in Homestead.{^n}{^n}Don't be thinking such foolishness will go unnoticed around here.{^n}{^n}I'll be keeping an eye on you.
Antics? Are you my mother or what?
Don't play coy with me. You know what I'm talking about.
Yes, mother.
Yeah, alright.
Duly noted.
I'm not here to cause trouble.
I have no desire to speak with someone like you.
Someone like me?
Yes, inquisitor.{^n}{^n}I have drawn the blood of your brethren countless times.{^n}{^n}Don't test my patience.
I'd love to see you try.
I'm leaving.
Well alright then.
I'm a bit busy right now.
Sorry to bother you.
I'll be on my way.
