I can't thank you enough for getting us out there. {^n}{^n}I told them I wasn't fit for exploring such dangerous places, but Keisen wanted supplies and we are bound to serve.{^n}{^n}We were really lucky you showed up.
I'm glad I could help.
I got there just in time.
I hope they don't send me out on another supply run.
Goodbye.
