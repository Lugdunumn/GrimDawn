Darrion
Well if it isn't the talk of the camp.
You know who I am?
Of course.{^n}{^n}The seers of Dreeg have extolled your acts in Burrwitch, and even those yet to be.{^n}{^n}That is before they all started rambling on about death and the inevitable darkness that will consume all.{^n}{^n}Lura in particular seems to have taken interest in your arrival, but you can take that up with her.{^n}{^n}If you don't mind, I have a bit more of a personal question to ask.
Death and darkness?
Yes, something's been affecting many of the seers here in camp.{^n}{^n}I've bound myself to the will of Dreeg many years ago, but I've never seen them so disturbed.{^n}{^n}I was never blessed with the gift of sight. It doesn't seem to be much of a blessing right now. 
Why is that?
After we established the Conclave, the seers of Dreeg immediately got to work deciphering the strands of fate that bind this place.{^n}{^n}But instead they began speaking of horrific visions. Dark and horrible things that defy understanding.{^n}{^n}Every day, they seem to worsen. Some have already taken their own lives rather than endure another night of these nightmares.{^n}{^n}Others succumbed to madness trying to decipher their meaning. Disagreements would break out among the seers over the dark portents.Just a few days ago, several of the afflicted stormed out of camp, rambling on about fire and embers and the lies of the Three.{^n}{^n}I do not know where they planned on going, but their betrayal will be met with a painful end, to be sure.
Interesting.
If you don't mind, I've got something to ask of you.

Sorry, I need to be going.
Not right now.
Thanks for sharing.
We'll finish later, I need to go.
I don't have time for this.
Go ahead.
It's about a child, a little girl.{^n}{^n}Perhaps in your travels you may have met her and those who now care for her.
What is her name?
I'm afraid I don't know what her name is. 
You don't know?
You see, I was traveling along the shore north of Port Valbury with a small group from the coven at Stonereach.{^n}{^n}We sought to regroup with our brothers and sisters fleeing the carnage in the city.{^n}{^n}We searched for two days without luck, but on the third morning we spotted a small boat just off-shore.{^n}{^n}It appeared to be empty, but I could swear I heard the cries of an infant coming from it.{^n}{^n}I braved the waters and fixed a line to it and together we pulled it ashore.
And what did you find?
The sight we beheld burned my very soul.{^n}{^n}At first glance, it appeared there was nothing but death, human remains twisted and mangled, laying with other creatures the likes of which I've never seen.{^n}{^n}But there in the midst of it all was a baby, just as pristine as if her mom had laid her down for an afternoon nap.{^n}{^n}She couldn't have been more than a couple years old. How that child survived whatever happened in that boat is beyond me, but when I picked her up she looked up at me with a bright smile and her beautiful green eyes. Some of the others were spooked. They kept going on about how it was impossible such a small child could have survived the carnage, how there was something unnatural about her.{^n}{^n}But I knew we had to take care of her. In the cult of Dreeg, there are no coincidences. We were intended to find this girl.So I brought her back to the coven at Stonereach. The matron agreed to raise her, but I couldn't bear to leave her side.{^n}{^n}That is until I was summoned here. One does not deny the call of Draellus. I couldn't very well bring an infant here with me, not to this forsaken land.{^n}{^n}It broke my heart to leave her.{^n}{^n}I just thought maybe you may have been there, maybe you have news of her?
That may be Alice, Van Aldritch's daughter.
You say her name is Alice?{^n}{^n}How would you know this?
She was taken from her mother in Port Valbury.
Oh...that must be her...Alice.{^n}{^n}Little Alice.{^n}{^n}What of her mother? Did she survive Valbury?
She seeks her child. She went to Malmouth.
Malmouth is no better place than Valbury these days.{^n}{^n}She's walking into a death-trap.{^n}{^n}Dreeg forgive me, perhaps I can still do something, but we're so far from Erulan...
There's no hope of that, I'm afraid.
I'm not sure it's worth the risk.
Good luck then.
I'm sorry, I haven't seen the little girl.
It was worth asking, I suppose.{^n}{^n}Hopefully she is well and my duties here will not keep me from her for long.{^n}{^n}If you see her before I do, make sure she's safe, will you?
What were you saying about Death and Darkness?
Ya, it's kind of crazy if you ask me.{^n}{^n}I've served Dreeg for as long as anyone here in the camp, as far as I know. {^n}{^n}But I've never been blessed with the gift of sight. {^n}{^n}It doesn't seem like much of a blessing right now. 
I will.
Sure, I'll tell the nameless baby you miss her.
Sorry, we'll have to talk later.
I don't have time to chat.
Well that's great.
No, I'm sorry.
Maybe we can chat again later.
Maybe later.
Oh, you've heard of me?

Yup, that's me.
