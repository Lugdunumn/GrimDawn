Father Kymon, Avatar of Korvaak
So now you understand that I did what I had to.
No, now I see just how insane you are!

Please, stop this madness.
You fail to understand. Everything I've done has been to save humanity.{^n}{^n}Yes, Korvaak exacts a price upon our very souls, but it is a price I am willing to pay to stop the ravages of the void.
Who are you to decide humanity's fate?
I am the only one with eyes open enough to see that we've run out of options.{^n}{^n}If it falls to me to make this difficult choice, then I will gladly bear it. My soul be damned.
This is all wrong! (Attack)

I will stop you! (Attack)
I can't let you do this.
It is beyond stopping. Korvaak is risen and his revenge upon the false gods will be absolute.{^n}{^n}I can see that there is no convincing you of my path. Turn back now and be spared, or else I will be forced to end your life where you stand.
False gods?
You do not know? The very gods you allied with are nothing more than lies.{^n}{^n}The Three are not true gods, merely usurpers who will get their just rewards.{^n}{^n}Korvaak is humanity's only hope against Ch'thon and the legions of the void.
You're delusional.
I did what I had to!{^n}{^n}Humanity already lost this war. We require the aid of a greater power. A power that seeks the destruction of Chthonians above all else.{^n}{^n}Some deaths are inevitable. A small price to pay for the survival of our people.
This madness ends here! (Attack)
Doesn't matter. I will stop you! (Attack)

I will stop you! (Attack)
There's nothing to discuss, Kymon. Die! (Attack)
I am sorry, my [[ms]brother[fs]sister]. Korvaak has seen into your heart.{^n}{^n}The corruption within makes you unworthy of his gifts.{^n}{^n}I cannot allow you to impede my crusade.
Father Kymon? Why are you doing this?
What I achieved here this day is paramount to humanity's survival.{^n}{^n}Korvaak may be a bane upon this world, but he is also our only hope against the darkness that's already consuming Cairn.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Sun is our salvation, not the false gods you serve.

It is beyond stopping. Korvaak is risen and his revenge upon the false gods will be absolute.{^n}{^n}You are but a gnat caught in the hurricane. Turn back now and perhaps you will be spared.

It is too late.{^n}{^n}Turn back now. Return to whatever loved ones you still cherish and perhaps you will evade Korvaak's wrath.
Father Kymon? Why are you doing this?
Do you not see? If not for my actions, humanity would already be doomed.{^n}{^n}Korvaak may be a bane upon this world, but he is also our only hope against the darkness that's already consuming Cairn.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Sun is our salvation, not the false gods you serve.
