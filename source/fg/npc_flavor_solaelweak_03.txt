Vikon ~ Oathkeeper of Solael
Please do not distract me from my task.
Sorry, I'll be going.
Excuse me.
When you chose me as a sacrifice, I figured we'd end it with bloody battle.{^n}{^n}But here we are.
Perhaps it was not meant to be.
Stick to your duties.
I regret that we did not have the opportunity to face each other in ritual combat.{^n}{^n}I would have enjoyed giving my life or taking yours in the name of Solael.{^n}{^n}It would have been a grand show, no matter the outcome.{^n}{^n}But if it is my fate to live in the service of Solael, so be it.
We can still duel.
Hah, do not tempt me!{^n}{^n}No, I must maintain my post.{^n}{^n}Partaking in ritual combat without command to do so would be an offense to Solael and a disgrace to my title.
Very well.
That's too bad.
Farewell.
So there is to be a ritual of sacrifice.{^n}{^n}If I am under consideration then truly I have failed Sagon in my duties. But if offering myself before Solael is to be my final act of service, so be it.{^n}{^n}Shall we begin?
You want to die?
I wish only to serve Solael, whatever it takes.{^n}{^n}But I also relish the thought of you and I fighting to the death. It will be quite a bloody show and I am eager for a good fight.{^n}{^n}You may be surprised who it is that ends up giving their life in honor of Solael.
Let's find out. (Attack)
No, I don't think so.
No, it will not be you.
Ah, you're the one they've been talking about.{^n}{^n}Worked with Kymon and his band of merry fanatics, back in Homestead.{^n}{^n}I'll tell you what, if it weren't for what you've done since I'd end your life where you stand.
Excuse me?
You heard me. {^n}{^n}I don't know why they've allowed you into this camp, but I assure you, I'll be looking for a good reason to remove you from the land of the living.
And why's that?
You see all of this here? {^n}{^n}All of these people? They're gathered here because that foolish maniac Father Kymon has been meddling with powers he can't control.{^n}{^n}Something you helped him do, whether you realize or not.{^n}{^n}If it were up to me you'd be cut down just for setting foot in this camp.
I'd love to see you try.
Good thing it's not up to you.
Welcome, Oathkeeper. {^n}{^n}I am truly glad that you have joined us my [[ms]brother[fs]sister].{^n}{^n}Is there anything I can help you with?
What are you doing here?
I am guarding my post. I am, always, guarding my post.{^n}{^n}As an Oathkeeper of Solael, it is my life sworn duty to defend Sagon.{^n}{^n}Though, I can see that your calling is quite a bit different than my own.{^n}{^n}Yet the Three have called you here to aid in their endeavor. So they must have a great deal of faith in you.
Who is Sagon?
That, my friend, is a question I am ill-prepared to answer.{^n}{^n}I have served as a guardian to Sagon since I was old enough to hold a shield.{^n}{^n}But most of that time was not spent at his side. No, most of it was spent guarding ancient sites of worship or covens in service to Solael.{^n}{^n}I go where Sagon wills me to go and I don't ask questions. Such is my duty.{^n}{^n}Though, between you and I, I desperately crave a good fight.{^n}{^n}It has been far too long since I spilled the blood of a worthy foe.

Hope you find one a worthy one soon then.
Too bad for you.
Farewell.
What is this place?
You are standing in the Conclave of the Three, a sacred gathering of the servants of the Witch Gods.
Why is everyone here?
I only know what Sagon wishes me to know.{^n}{^n}It appears a mad zealot named Father Kymon is heralding the return of a mighty foe that has even the gods concerned.{^n}{^n}He's uncovered something terrible out there in the desert. It must be pretty bad as up til now we thought him as little more than a crazy fool; and now we are all gathered here in numbers never seen before.{^n}{^n}But it is not my place to question our purpose here. I live to serve Sagon.{^n}{^n}May the Three be with you, [[ms]brother[fs]sister].

Thank you, brother.
And with you.
One step closer and I'll take your life, inquisitor.
Excuse me?
You heard me. {^n}{^n}I don't know why they've allowed you into this camp, but I assure you, I'll be looking for a good reason to remove you from the land of the living.
Why such hostility?
An inquisitor asks a servant of Solael why the hostility...this is precious.{^n}{^n}Did you hit your head on the way here, inquisitor?{^n}{^n}Just stay out of my way before things get ugly.
Alright, I'm going.
There's no need for that.
Good luck.
Please do not distract me from my task.
What are you doing here?
I am an Oathkeeper of Solael. I am the sword, and the shield, I am righteous wrath.{^n}{^n}It is my sworn duty to defend brother Sagon and I will do so with my life, and yours if need be.
Wow, that's a mouthful.
Watch yourself, stranger.{^n}{^n}I make no threats, keep your distance and we shall have no quarrel.
And if I don't?
Then I will strike you down where you stand.{^n}{^n}But now is not the time for such ignorance. I'm sure you know this.{^n}{^n}You are an ally of the Three, are you not?{^n}{^n}Now please leave me to my duty.
Keep up the good work.
Perhaps another time.
Keep up the good work.
Well, excuse me.
Sorry, I'll be going.
Excuse me.
