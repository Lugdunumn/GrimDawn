Spirit of Crate
You know not what you've unleashed.{^n}{^n}Foolish mortal.
I can handle it.
A mortal has broken the first of the six sacred seals, such a sight is a rarity to behold.{^n}{^n}I can't help but wonder what [[ms]he[fs]she] hopes to achieve with such blasphemy.
Where are the other seals?
Tread carefully, mortal.{^n}{^n}Some secrets of the desert are best left unbroken.
You won't tell me?
*The spirit stares blankly at you*{^n}{^n}Tread carefully, mortal.{^n}{^n}Some secrets of the desert are best left unbroken.
Fine, don't tell me.
Fine, don't tell me.

Um, ok.
