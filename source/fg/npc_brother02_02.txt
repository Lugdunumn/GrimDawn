Thanks for the help back there.{^n}{^n}I don't think I would have made it without your portal thing.
What about your brother?
What, Anderan?{^n}{^n}He's fine.
He's dead.
No, technically he's undead. Or a ghost, or something.{^n}{^n}I'll admit, it's strange and I'm not sure what you call it. But he's never been better, as far as I can tell.{^n}{^n}He's about as smart as a box of rocks, so I'm not sure it matters to him if he's a ghost or not.{^n}{^n}At least we're all together again.
So...what's next? 
Well, I'll tell you what, I can't wait to get back to work. {^n}{^n}Nika has already been down here trying to get us to go back out to the desert and with Anderan's new...condition, just imagine all the places we'll be able to get into.{^n}{^n}It's gonna be a great year!
Even though your brother is dead.
Good luck with that.
Interesting.
Glad to help.
Can't say I've ever been tossed through a portal before.{^n}{^n}You Witch God people are a strange lot.{^n}{^n}Have you found my other brother yet?
I'm still working on it.
I can't believe I just left him down there. {^n}{^n}I thought he was right behind me, he's always right behind me.{^n}{^n}I hope he's ok.
You did what you had to do.
I'll find him.
Don't worry, I'll find him.
Hey there fellow traveler.{^n}{^n}I'm a bit busy right now.
Talk to you later.
