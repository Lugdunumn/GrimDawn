Just leave me alone.
Alright.
So we're staying then? {^n}{^n}Good to hear, I'd hate to think that beatdown you gave us was for nothing.
It was fun.
It was a good beatdown, wasn't it?
Wasn't enough huh? {^n}{^n}Taking that beatdown you gave us, just wasn't enough punishment to earn us a spot?{^n}{^n}Suppose it won't slow us down any. I'm sure Atrin will think of something.
Interesting.
Well, good luck with that.
Just leave me alone.
Alright.
Now that was a great fight.{^n}{^n}I don't think I've had a whooping like that since I was a kid.{^n}{^n}Back when Atrin and Niran used to pretend I was some evil god and they were going to save the world from me. {^n}{^n}I'm gonna be sore for days.
You fought well.
Good for you.
Just leave me alone.
Alright.
