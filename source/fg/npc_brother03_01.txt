Anderan
*Anderan looks at his ghostly hands*{^n}{^n}Now that I'm a ghost do you think I'll still be able to eat? {^n}{^n}I mean, will I get hungry? Can I even taste things? {^n}{^n}I don' t think I can go on living without some good old grobble stew.{^n}{^n}"Go on living", what am I saying?{^n}{^n}None of this makes any sense.{^n}{^n}Man, this just sucks.
Ok, good luck being dead.
Maybe I'll come back later.
This is not how I thought this day would go.
Did you die recently?
Uh, yup.{^n}{^n}That's my body down there...or was my body.{^n}{^n}I don't know this is all very confusing.{^n}{^n}You've gotta give me some space so I can take it all in.
Ok, good luck being dead.
Maybe I'll come back later.
This is so weird.
What's weird?
Being dead...{^n}{^n}I mean, I don't feel dead, but there I am just layin' there. Then again, I'm also standin' over here.{^n}{^n}It's like some strange dream where I'm watchin' myself sleep.{^n}{^n}Only I don't think I'm gonna wake up from this one. It really doesn't make any sense.{^n}{^n}I wonder what's gonna happen when you stop that maniac downstairs.
What am I supposed to be doing again?
The mad priest, that old freak downstairs, he's the one who did this.{^n}{^n}He's down there in the temple somewhere.{^n}{^n}If you take him out maybe you can put an end to whatever he's done to me.{^n}{^n}Though, that makes me wonder. Am I gonna disappear or somethin'?{^n}{^n}Can ghosts die...am I just gonna die again?{^n}{^n}I dunno, this is all so confusing. {^n}{^n}Just go down there and kill that guy for me would you?
Ok, got it.
Who knows. I'll be back to check on you.
You'll probably still be dead.
Hey, stop fiddlin' with my body.{^n}{^n}You shouldn't go around messin' with every random corpse ya come across.
Um, you're dead.
Ya, no kiddin'.{^n}{^n}You're a smart one ain't ya?{^n}{^n}Sorry, I don't mean to be rude. This is just a new thing for me.
Being dead?
Ya, being dead...Are you toyin' with me?{^n}{^n}I gotta be honest stranger. I don't feel dead.{^n}{^n}I mean, I can see you there pokin' around my corpse but here I am, just standin' here.{^n}{^n}I guess I'm a ghost or somethin'.{^n}{^n}What do ya know about that?
Your brothers sent me to find you.
Aaral and Anorak? {^n}{^n}So Aaral made it out alright? That damn rat. When I told him to run I didn't mean for him to take off on me.{^n}{^n}I suppose I can't blame him. I probably scared the pants off him screamin' about how we had to get outta here.
What happened down here?
Well, we got down to the heart of the temple expectin' to find nothin' but skeletons and a bunch of loot. But there's a crazy old man down there with an army of ghosts. {^n}{^n}Without so much as sayin' hello, the old freak cast some sort of spell at me. I panicked and told Aaral to run.{^n}{^n}We took off for the exit, like a couple of scared kids, and the whole place started shakin', rocks fallin' from the ceiling and everythin'. I was dodgin' left and right but I think one of 'em musta clocked me right in the mellon cause everything went black all the sudden. {^n}{^n}Then the next thing I remember is lookin' down at you snoopin' around my body.{^n}{^n}Must be the old man's spell that turned me into a ghost...or whatever this is.{^n}{^n}Somethin' tells me I ain't gettin' outa here 'til somebody puts a stop to that old bastard's schemin'.{^n}{^n}Don't suppose you're up for a good fight. Wanna go down there and beat some sense into that old weirdo?
He's already dead.
Wow, really? {^n}{^n}You do work fast. I was so confused 'bout being stuck here I didn't think to check that the old bastard was gone.{^n}{^n}Now, what do you suppose is gonna happen to me? {^n}{^n}Am I gonna die again? Can ghosts even die?{^n}{^n}This is all very weird.
I have no idea.
I'll take care of him.
No, I don't think so.
Good luck being a ghost.
I don't have time for this.
Ok.
This is not how I thought this day would go.
Um...goodbye.
