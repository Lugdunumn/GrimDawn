Mazaan, Keeper of Portals
The Shattered Realm awaits.{^n}{^n}Tarry not, for the portal is as unstable as the pocket reality beyond.
This realm is beyond my abilities.
Are you certain of this?{^n}{^n}I can close the portal and you could begin your journey anew, but any wealth therein would be forfeit.
Yes, close the portal. (Reset Shattered Realm)
Nevermind.
What can I expect beyond?
Honestly, I cannot say. The Shattered Realm is a reflection of our own, but it is...splintered...distorted.{^n}{^n}You may witness things that seem all too familiar and yet not.
I see.
I'm going inside now.
I need some time to prepare.
