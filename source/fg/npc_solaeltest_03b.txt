If you need something, speak to Atrin.
Goodbye.
That was not an easy trial.{^n}{^n}It's a relief to know we passed.
You're welcome.
Just barely.
So now you're just going to make us leave?
Yes.
If that's the way it has to be, so be it.{^n}{^n}The three of us will find our way on our own.{^n}{^n}We always have.
Find your way where?
Wherever that bastard godling is threatening to break loose.{^n}{^n}That's why we're here after all.{^n}{^n}Witches or no witches, we're going to find where it's hiding and seal it once and for all.
Good luck with that.
Um, sure you will.
Good luck out there.
Sure you will.
It's nothing personal.
If you need something, speak to Atrin.
Goodbye.
That was intense.{^n}{^n}I hope our efforts have at least shown what we're capable of.
They have.
Yup, and it's not much.
If you need something, speak to Atrin.
Goodbye.
