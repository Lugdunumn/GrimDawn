Sister Girra
Our spirits are crushed and our bodies broken, please leave us alone.{^n}{^n}We have nothing of value.
Farewell.
Greetings, [[ms]brother[fs]sister].{^n}{^n}I do not know what brought you to these lands, but you should turn back.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon has betrayed us all.
What can I expect up ahead?
You will find our brothers and sisters that followed Kymon into this hell and offered themselves to a malevolent power.{^n}{^n}They are our brothers and sisters no longer, they've been turned into...something no longer human.


Good luck in your journey.
Thanks for the info.
I fight for Kymon no longer.
Then you too have seen the truth?{^n}{^n}Father Kymon offered us a chance in a dying world, a means to fight back against the blood cults and their dark masters.{^n}{^n}He selected us from among the most zealous and asked us to follow him to this forsaken land.{^n}{^n}We believed we were seeking a weapon to vanquish the Chthonians. I had no idea that in truth we would unleash something far worse.{^n}{^n}It was all a lie. Empyrion is not with us. There is only...Korvaak.
What has Kymon done?
We were fools to listen to his promises, and now all of Cairn will pay for our mistakes.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon uncovered something ancient...primordial...it is beyond mortal comprehension.
The others at Sorrow's Bastion must be told.
True, they must be warned of this betrayal.{^n}{^n}We may be Kymon's Chosen no longer, but our mission to protect Cairn remains the same.{^n}{^n}But how can we get word to them now?
I can rift all of you there.
Astounding, and...concerning.{^n}{^n}But I will do whatever it takes. The others, however, may be too injured too travel by such means.
I'll see you there. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be back.
Good luck in your journey.
I'll be back.
Good luck in your journey.
Farewell.


Good luck in your journey.
Farewell.
Father Kymon is dead.
So the false prophet lies dead...that does offer a measure of relief.{^n}{^n}But I fear it may already be too late. He has unleashed something terrifying beneath that temple.
What has he done?

Our spirits are crushed and our bodies broken.{^n}{^n}Please move on, we have nothing of value.
You're Kymon's Chosen? Which makes you the enemy!
No! Hold your weapons.{^n}{^n}We...we were deceived. Father Kymon offered us a chance in a dying world, a means to fight back against the blood cults and their dark masters.{^n}{^n}But it was all a lie. Empyrion is not with us. There is only...Korvaak.{^n}{^n}After witnessing the horrors of this truth, we've abandoned Kymon's camp and are heading back to Erulan...if we survive.


Who are you?
We once proudly called ourselves Kymon's Chosen, but I can no longer abide by such a name.{^n}{^n}We...we were deceived. Father Kymon offered us a chance in a dying world, a means to fight back against the blood cults and their dark masters.{^n}{^n}But it was all a lie. Empyrion is not with us. There is only...Korvaak.{^n}{^n}After witnessing the horrors of this truth, we've abandoned Kymon's camp and are heading back to Erulan...if we survive.
I fight to stop Kymon.
Then I pray to the true Empyrion that you find victory, though I honestly cannot see how.{^n}{^n}He has unleashed something terrifying beneath that temple.
What has Kymon done?
We were fools to listen to his promises, and now all of Cairn will pay for our mistakes.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon uncovered something ancient...primordial...it is beyond mortal comprehension.
Then I hope for your sake you are wrong.
Good luck in your journey.
