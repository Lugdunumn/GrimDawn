Merise
I think we've spoken enough.{^n}{^n}Leave me.
Ok.
*Merise sighs deeply*{^n}{^n}I thought being chosen as a sacrifice would release me from the foolish gaze of that creeper, Ricard.{^n}{^n}But here I am.
I guess not.

So, Ricard is gone.{^n}{^n}I suppose this means he won't be bothering me anymore, but he didn't deserve that fate.
He didn't deserve what?
He didn't deserve to give his life in honor of Solael.{^n}{^n}Such a fate is too glorious for that groveling fool.
Wow, that's cold.
You're probably right.
Maybe he didn't.
He probably did.
Hello again.{^n}{^n}I appreciate you sparing my life but I fear I may have missed an opportunity to prove my loyalty to Solael.{^n}{^n}Such an opportunity is rare.{^n}{^n}I suppose I must focus on my work to show my continued devotion.
You'll be fine.
You're welcome.
At least you don't have to deal with Ricard.
I suppose you're here because you've chosen me?{^n}{^n}Well, I accept. I will gladly give my life in honor of Solael if that is what's required of me.{^n}{^n}That may finally put a stop to Ricard's madness.{^n}{^n}
Who's Ricard?
That grubby creeper who keeps following me around.{^n}{^n}If I am to give my life in honor of Solael, at least I won't have to deal with him anymore.{^n}{^n}Now, if you've chosen me, let's get to it.

No, I've changed my mind.
I'm sorry to do this.
No need to apologize.{^n}{^n}I accept my fate. But would you grant me an honorable death in combat?
As you wish. (Attack)
I've changed my mind.
No, that's not it.
Is there something you need?
It's about Ricard.
Look, you tell that grubby stalker to mind his own business.{^n}{^n}I've told him before, I don't want anything to do with him.{^n}{^n}But he keeps following me around, leaving little notes in my tent, in my gear, and in my clothes.{^n}{^n}My clothes! That greasy creeper has been touching my clothes!
That is creepy.
You're telling me.{^n}{^n}I have serious work to do, but I can't finish it because I have to deal with him following me around all the time.{^n}{^n}And now, he's asking strangers to follow me around too.{^n}{^n}Look, I'm sorry you got tangled up in this but you have to tell him to stay away from me.{^n}{^n}I just can't deal with this anymore.{^n}{^n}Would you do that for me?
Maybe you should give him a chance.
A chance at what?{^n}{^n}I've tried speaking with him, he just blushes like a child and runs off giggling.{^n}{^n}No, I think I've given him enough of a chance.{^n}{^n}It's time for that little weasel to leave me alone.{^n}{^n}You go and tell him if he doesn't stay away from me I'm going to send the sentinels on him.{^n}{^n}I'm sure they can think of creative ways to do away with somebody disrupting our work for Solael.
I'll speak with him.
That's too bad.
I'll speak with him.
Nope, good luck.
Sorry, I need to go.
Ok, I don't have time for this.
What do you do around here?
It's my job to gather supplies for the various spells, rituals, and incantations performed here in the Solael camp.{^n}{^n}It's a never-ending task, as you can imagine; particularly with everything that's going on right now.{^n}{^n}Recently, it's been even more difficult because of that nosy dimwit, Ricard.{^n}{^n}He follows me everywhere, it's maddening.{^n}{^n}I've tried speaking with him about it but he just blushes like a child and runs off.{^n}{^n}How can a grown man act like such a fool? Actually, can you do me a favor?
Sure.
Go over there and tell Ricard to leave me alone or I'll tell the sentinels he's disrupting vital ritual work for Solael.{^n}{^n}That should put a stop to his foolishness, for a while.{^n}{^n}Perhaps then I can get back to my work.
I'll talk with him.
I don't think so.
Sorry I don't have time.
Nope, I'm not interested in your affairs.
Nothing, sorry to bother you.
I'm a bit busy right now, come back and see me when you've finished with the Emissary.
Alright, I will.
Sorry to bother you.
