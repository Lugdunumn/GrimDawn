The Messenger
Seer Laurna of the Dreeg cult peered into the veil and uncovered the location of a mighty servant of Korvaak known only as the Messenger.{^n}{^n}Folk tales would describe a fiery visage coming to people in their dreams or in times of desperation, offering them salvation and solace from their life's woes.{^n}{^n}It is this harbinger of Korvaak's fiery wrath that bound the foolish Kymon's Chosen to the forgotten god's will.{^n}{^n}Eliminating the Messenger would be a critical blow to Korvaak's forces. Follow Laurna's vision to a place called the Pit of Atonement, an active volcano within the ruins of Korvan City northwest of the Infernal Wastes. Find the Messenger and destroy it.
Destroy the Messenger

Return to Seer Laurna
The Messenger has been slain by your hand.{^n}{^n}Return to Seer Laurna at the Vanguard of the Three with the good news.
