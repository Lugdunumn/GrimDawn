Keisen
We all heard the screams of an agonized god.{^n}{^n}They were as terrifying as they were relieving.{^n}{^n}Our desperate war is over. The Three reign victorious.
Farewell.
What is it?
What can you tell me about this camp?
It is a gathering of some of the most powerful servants of the Three ever to converge upon one place.{^n}{^n}Here, we are united in purpose, if not in faith.{^n}{^n}This particular location was selected for very important reasons. What you may not know is that this was once a religious site.{^n}{^n}The Korvan people, it appears, knew something of the magics we wield. They sensed the potential in the very air, the energies that tear at the fabric of reality.{^n}{^n}Here the veil is thin. It enables us to perform rituals of supreme power and allows Sagon to draw upon the Eldritch flame in ways I did not even believe possible.{^n}{^n}It is also here that a portal was once opened to another realm. We have secured it for our own purposes.{^n}{^n}Now the same rift hungrily consumes reality around it at the center of camp, but you can speak to Mazaan about that.

That's fascinating.
Yes, I've seen it.
What can you tell me about our foe?
It is an ancient being, primordial in nature and supremely powerful. It once ruled over this land and the people here worshipped it.{^n}{^n}That is until the very god they revered turned on them and turned the land to ash and fire.{^n}{^n}This spiteful being has but one name: Korvaak.{^n}{^n}Now, a brainwashed former inquisitor by the name Kymon seeks to resurrect this forgotten god. The Witch Gods are rightfully concerned and so we are here to make sure this does not happen. If we fail here, all of Cairn will be in even greater danger than the Aetherials and Chthonians have brought down upon us. As you can surmise, that is not an option.

I see.
Sounds like a bunch of fairy tales to me.
Nothing, sorry to bother you.
Serve the Three and prosper.{^n}{^n}Deny them and...
I get the idea...
And? How did these recruits do?
They are worthy.
Hmm, excellent to hear.{^n}{^n}More blood in the service of Solael. More loyal servants to live and die in his glorious name.{^n}{^n}Perhaps we'll start them where the scavenging crew failed...
Just don't expect me to go rescue them.
Farewell.
It didn't go well.
Not surprising.{^n}{^n}I'll be sure to let those fools under Dreeg's banner know that they've wasted our precious time.{^n}{^n}Thank you for doing this. If they're not already dead, then I trust you've sent them away.{^n}{^n}They have no place in the Conclave.
They will be leaving soon.
If they don't leave, I'll take care of them. 
Have you tested the worth of these new recruits?
What am I supposed to be doing?
A trio arrived in camp and the seers say they are to join the Cult of Solael.{^n}{^n}I'm not quite as inviting. Speak to them on my behalf and administer a trial by bloody combat, then let me know if they are worthy of Solael's gifts.
Alright, I'll hurt them for you.
I'm on it.
Still working on it.
I have to say, you've exceeded my expectations.{^n}{^n}Perhaps there is another thing you can assist me with. Something more...enjoyable.
What is it?
A trio arrived in camp. The seers of Dreeg had witnessed their coming on their tapestry or whatever nonsense they spew.{^n}{^n}They insist that the trio belongs with us, under the servitude of Solael.{^n}{^n}I'm not quite as inviting. If they wish to pledge themselves to the Dark One, then they must be tested.{^n}{^n}If you're interested, you can administer their trial.{^n}{^n}Speak to them here at our camp and determine their worth through bloody combat, then inform me of their value to Solael.
Consider it done.
Test your own recruits.
I don't have time right now.
I see the artifacts have been recovered...oh, and the aspirants too.{^n}{^n}I have you to thank for that?
Yes, your aspirants are safe now.
Yes, they're bruised, exhausted and shaken up, but they did their job.{^n}{^n}The artifacts they found should be of use. At the very least, they should offer valuable insight, if not new secrets for us to learn.{^n}{^n}You've exceeded my expectations. Perhaps there is another thing you can assist me with. Something more...enjoyable.
What is it?

I'm glad they're safe.
They had no business being out there.
Have you found the supplies?
What am I supposed to be doing again?
I've sent a group of aspirants to the Temple of Osyr to the north in search of supplies.{^n}{^n}There has been no word of their return, but we still need whatever they've found.{^n}{^n}Go to the temple and recover whatever they managed to scavenge.
I'm on it.
I'm working on it.
With all the chaos around here, I didn't even take notice of your trials.{^n}{^n}Care to put yourself to use?
Alright, what do you need?
What was once a joint pursuit of a raving zealot and his brainwashed followers has turned into a full-on assault on a primordial being. To say that we were ill-prepared for a conflict of this magnitude is an understatement.{^n}{^n}But it's also no secret that this region is teeming with old secrets and forgotten artifacts, a resource we can take advantage of to augment our dwindling arcane supplies.{^n}{^n}I've sent out a group of aspirants to scour the Temple of Osyr to the north of anything valuable.{^n}I expected them to return by now, but nobody's seen them.{^n}{^n}If you're going to make yourself useful, go out there and find whatever they've scavenged; and bring them back too, I suppose.
I'll find the artifacts.
Not right now.
I've already found your aspirants.
Have you now?{^n}{^n}I've been so occupied, I hadn't even noticed their return.{^n}{^n}And the supplies too, I take it? I appreciate the assist.{^n}{^n}Perhaps there is another thing you can assist me with. Something more...enjoyable.
What is it?

I'm glad they're back safe.
Don't send them out there again.
Not interested.
Serve the Three and prosper.{^n}{^n}Deny them and...
I get the idea...
