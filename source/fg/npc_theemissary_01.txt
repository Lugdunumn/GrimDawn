The Emissary
Hello, friend. We will speak again, but at present I seek another in your midst.
Farewell.
I will speak with you again on the far side of the portal, traveler.

Ah, we speak at last.{^n}{^n}As I am sure you know, there are many who now cast their gaze upon you, traveler, or should I say Taken? Some who mean you ill, some who fear your potential.{^n}{^n}Then there are those who command me. You know them well, for their attendant's mark is upon you.{^n}{^n}They wish to collect upon this gift.
Collect? Meaning what?
I cannot speak of such things in this place. The cursed gaze of our foes is cast upon us here, so I will be brief.{^n}{^n}Great powers are gathering within the distant lands of the fallen Korvan people and the Great Eye has decreed that you must play a part, whatever that may be.{^n}{^n}Will you answer our summons? Will you join me through the portal? Or do the mortal concerns of these people outweigh the calls of fate?{^n}{^n}(This begins the Forgotten Gods expansion content)
Very well.
I have some other matters to attend to first.
Who are these masters of yours?
You have not met them, but you've sought out their temple.{^n}{^n}Do not fear, you have mutual interests, and the same enemies.{^n}{^n}If we work together, we can triumph where the individual cannot!{^n}{^n}(This begins the Forgotten Gods expansion content)
Very well, I'll trust you.
No way I'm following a stranger through a portal.


Uhh, I think I'll be going.
Hold that thought.
Ah, we speak at last.{^n}{^n}As I am sure you know, there are many who now cast their gaze upon you, traveler, or should I say Taken? Some who mean you ill, some who fear your potential.{^n}{^n}Then there are those who command me. They have taken great interest in your accomplishments. It appears you may be just the one we require.
You require me? For what?

Very well.

Who are these masters of yours?
I am sorry, I cannot say more here. All you need to know is that you have mutual interests, and the same enemies.{^n}{^n}But if we work together, we can triumph where the individual cannot!{^n}{^n}(This begins the Forgotten Gods expansion content)
Very well, I'll trust you.
No way I'm following a stranger through a portal.

Where is this land of the Korvan people?
Far to the east, beyond mountains and rivers. Weeks of travel by foot, a mere instant through an eldritch gate.{^n}{^n}My masters have granted me the means to return there, but only if accompanied by you. I will not fail in this task.{^n}{^n}(This begins the Forgotten Gods expansion content)
Very well, I'll trust you.

Uhh, I think I'll be going.
Hold that thought.
Leave me be, traveler. You are not the one I seek.
Who are you looking for?
It matters not. They will seek me out when the time comes.
Ok, whatever.
Um, alright.
