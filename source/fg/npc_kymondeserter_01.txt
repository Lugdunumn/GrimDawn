Brother Haggan
Please, have mercy.{^n}{^n}We've suffered enough.
We'll see about that.
Thank you for your mercy.
Travel safe.
Go on, before I change my mind.
We don't want any trouble.
Then stay out of it.
Thank you for your mercy.
I dropped the relic somewhere, don't suppose you...
Found it?{^n}{^n}Yes, here. If this is the price for our lives, take it.
Thank you.
Travel safe.
Go on, before I change my mind.
Do not try to stop us, [[ms]brother[fs]sister].{^n}{^n}We have had enough of Kymon's lies and wish to leave in peace. If you have any sense left, you should join us.
I do not wish to fight you, brother, but you have something I need.
What could we possibly have that you require in this wasteland?{^n}{^n}We are fleeing the destruction that awaits us all if Kymon succeeds and have only some supplies and the clothes on our backs.
You have an artifact. Give it to me and you can go.
*Haggan reluctantly removes something from a pouch on his belt*{^n}{^n}I don't know what you want with this, [[ms]brother[fs]sister], but it is evil.{^n}{^n}Kymon promised us salvation from this hell through Empyrion. Instead, we got something far worse.{^n}{^n}You do not want this burden.
I'll see that this thing never harms anyone again.
Aligning ourselves with Kymon and his false promises has brought us nothing but misery.{^n}{^n}*Haggan sighs*{^n}{^n}Take it. Get it away from us. Perhaps then we will know peace.
I'll be careful with it. (Spare the deserters)
Forget it. (Attack)
I'll be right back.
I don't have time for this. (Attack)
I'll be right back.

I'm sorry, but you have to die. (Attack)
I'll be right back.
Kymon's dead, you're next.
You felled the Father himself? Remarkable.{^n}{^n}Then we stand no chance.{^n}{^n}Look, we have no quarrel with you. We are leaving this forsaken land before Kymon's foolish plans come to fruition, and you should too.
What has he done?
Kymon was a false prophet. He deceived us with promises of Empyrion's return, but in truth he served another vile entity which he worked tirelessly to release into our world.{^n}{^n}That being will prove no different than the Chthonians, both will bring about our end.

And you will die for this. (Attack)
I'll be right back.
I do not fight for Kymon.
Then we have no quarrel.{^n}{^n}We are leaving this forsaken land before Kymon's foolish plans come to fruition, and you should too.
What has Kymon done?
He is a false prophet. He deceived us with promises of Empyrion's return, but in truth he served another vile entity which he is working tirelessly to release into our world.{^n}{^n}Just another charlatan seeking to take advantage of the suffering of survivors. We were fools to follow him here.

And you will die for it. (Attack)
I'll be right back.

You're not going anywhere. (Attack)
I'll be right back.
I'm afraid you're not leaving. (Attack)
I'll be right back.
Please leave us be.{^n}{^n}We have had enough of this forsaken land and Kymon's lies.{^n}{^n}We wish to leave peacefully. If you have any sense left, you should be leaving too.
I do not wish to fight you, but you have something I need.
