Ricard
What have you done!{^n}{^n}You monster! Merise did not deserve this fate!{^n}{^n}What's worse, I was left to live in a world without her star light!
Not by my choice.
She would have never loved you.
Leave me, I wish only to think about my darling Merise.
Good luck with that.
You're a crazy person.
Still trying to come between me and Merise, I see. {^n}{^n}Well your plan won't work, Merise only has eyes for me.
Sure she does.
Merise wishes you were dead.
What have you done!{^n}{^n}You monster! Merise did not deserve this fate!{^n}{^n}What's worse, you left me to live in a world without her star light!
Perhaps now you can set your life straight.
She would have never loved you.
Um, you're welcome.
What have you done!{^n}{^n}You monster! Merise did not deserve this fate!{^n}{^n}What's worse, you left me to live in a world without her star light!
Perhaps now you can set your life straight.
She would have never loved you.
Um, you're welcome.
Thank you for sparing me, stranger.{^n}{^n}After all that's happened, I think I see the error of my ways. {^n}{^n}I was blinded by my hopeless love for Merise. {^n}{^n}Now I see she could never love someone like me.
I'm glad I could help.
Yes, you see, I must redouble my faith in the Three, prove myself worthy of Solael once more.{^n}{^n}Only then, perhaps Merise will find it in her heart to submit to my love.{^n}{^n}I will have her at my side, no matter the price.
You're hopeless.
Yeah, that will work.
You're welcome.
You're right, she could never love you.
What have you done!{^n}{^n}You monster! You took Merise from this world!{^n}{^n}I...I...would cut the heart from your chest as you did mine but...{^n}{^n}Just end it...take me from this pitiless world. Perhaps I will join Merise beyond the veil.
Who's Merise again?
You...you fiend.{^n}{^n}You torment me even as you dare speak her name.{^n}{^n}If my arms and legs and my everything weren't shaking right now I'd...I'd...
Yup, your life is forfeit. (Attack)
You're pitiful.
Who's Merise?

Not a problem. (Attack)
No, you're not worthy of her.
No, you're too pathetic to be sacrificed.
You've come to select me, haven't you?{^n}{^n}I know what you're doing. You're going to get me sacrificed as an excuse to get rid of me so you can have Merise all to yourself.{^n}{^n}You're disgraceful. No matter what you do, you can't come between our love.
You're definitely insane.
I'm in love!{^n}{^n}And there's nothing you can do to keep me from my Merise!
We'll see about that. (Attack)
I suppose you're right.
Who's Merise again?
She's just the most beautiful creature I've ever seen.{^n}{^n}Her eyes are like the stars, her hair the waves of the ocean, her smell is of a spring day, and her...well, you know what I mean.{^n}{^n}But she won't so much as look at me.{^n}{^n}Oh, the Three forsake me. My life is forfeit without her.
Ok, I've heard enough.
Yup, your life is forfeit. (Attack)
You're pitiful.
Who's Merise?

Yup, that's what I'm going to do. (Attack)
You're not worth it.
Leave me alone.{^n}{^n}I'm in no condition to talk.
It's about Merise.
Merise! Did she speak of me?{^n}{^n}Oh please let it be true. My lovely Merise, how I pine for your affection.{^n}{^n}Why has she made me wait so long? Why has she kept her love from me all this time?{^n}{^n}Tell me, what does she ask of me?
You need to stay away from her. (Tell the truth)
What...It can't be true. {^n}{^n}What did you say to her? You said something bad about me didn't you?{^n}{^n}Or...Or, you want her for yourself, don' t you?!{^n}{^n}I can't believe you're trying to come between me and my one true love.{^n}{^n}How could you do something like this to me?{^n}{^n}You're a monster.
And you're insane?
Oh is that it? Now we're going for slander?{^n}{^n}What I think is you're trying to keep me away from my precious Merise.{^n}{^n}You can't do this. I'll have my Merise no matter what you say.
Just stay away from her.
Watch your back, Ricard.
She'll call the sentinels if you don't stay away.
Well I bet she will now that you set her against me.{^n}{^n}You can't do this, do you understand? I won't let you come between me and my Merise.{^n}{^n}I'll have her no matter what you say.{^n}
Just stay away from her.
Watch your back, Ricard.
She wants to talk to you. (Lie) 
Oh, I knew it.{^n}{^n}I could just feel it. She wants me as badly as I want her.{^n}{^n}Oh praise the Three, my life is complete.{^n}{^n}I don't know how to thank you.
Glad I could help.
Good luck with that.
You know what. Nevermind.
Talk to her yourself.
What's wrong?
What?{^n}{^n}Oh nothing...it's just...{^n}{^n}I can't keep my mind off her. No matter what I do. I can't focus on my work, I can't eat, I can't sleep.{^n}{^n}She's in my dreams. Oh is she ever in my dreams.{^n}{^n}All I can do is think of her.
Think of who?
Merise, of course. {^n}{^n}Is she not the most beautiful creature that ever lived?{^n}{^n}Her eyes are like the stars, her hair the waves of the ocean, her smell is of a spring day, and her...well, you know what I mean.{^n}{^n}But she won't so much as look at me.{^n}{^n}Oh, the Three forsake me. My life is forfeit without her.
Get a hold of yourself.
I know, I'm a wreck, but I just can't go on without her.{^n}{^n}If Raiken finds out I haven't been finishing my work, he'll have me burned alive.{^n}{^n}I just can't continue without at least speaking with her.{^n}{^n}But I'm a coward, I'm too scared. She'd never talk to a person like me.{^n}{^n}You though, you look tough and brave. You could help me.
How can I help you?
You could go talk to her for me.{^n}{^n}She would talk to you. I know she would. Just look at you.
I'll see what she says.
Nope, I don't think so.
Nope, I don't think so.
Nope, I don't have time for this.
I don't really care.
Ok, I'll be on my way then.
I can't talk right now, Merise is watching.
Who's Merise?
Who's Merise? She's the love of my life, that's who Merise is.{^n}{^n}Now please, would you leave before she sees us talking. {^n}{^n}I don't want her to get the wrong idea.
The wrong idea?
I don't want her to think I'm, you know...talking to you.{^n}{^n}You know what I mean.
I have no idea.
Um, sure.
Alright.
Goodbye.
