Alica
I've no desire to speak with you again.
Ok,
Whatever, lady.
I'm honored that you chose me as a sacrifice. I saw it as an opportunity to show the depth of my loyalty to Solael.{^n}{^n}But it seems it was not to be.
Sorry about that.
Thank you for sparing my life, friend.{^n}{^n}To be honest, it is a bit of a mixed blessing. I would gladly have given my life if that is what Solael demanded.{^n}{^n}But he must have spared me for a purpose. Now it is up to me to discover that purpose and live what remains of my life as he intends.{^n}{^n}Let me know if there's anything I can do for you.
I will.
Good luck.
Hello, is there something I might help you with?
Sagon has ordered a sacrifice.
Indeed, he has. {^n}{^n}Am I to be chosen for this noble end?{^n}{^n}I would gladly give my life in service of Solael.{^n}{^n}Without the Three, I would have lived a life without purpose.{^n}{^n}The least I can do is give what remains of mine to honor the will of Solael.
Prepare yourself. (Attack)
No, not you.


Another time, perhaps.
Die in the name of Solael! (Attack)
Are you lost, inquisitor?{^n}{^n}How is it that a member of the Luminari finds [[ms]himself[fs]herself] at the center of the worship they so desperately  sought to erase?{^n}{^n}{^n}
The Emissary summoned me.
Then this is where you belong, for reasons I'm sure we'll all discover.{^n}{^n}The emissary does not make mistakes, his actions speak for the Three.{^n}{^n}A word of caution though: there are many here who will not appreciate your presence.
Why is that?
For generations, the Luminari hunted our kind, stole our artifacts, and experimented on us for their own gain. All in the name of defending the empire.{^n}{^n}That time has long since passed and there are far greater threats to the empire than the few of us who remain.{^n}{^n}But there are many here who suffered at the hands of the Luminari and they are slow to forgive.{^n}{^n}Just tread lightly.{^n}{^n}Now, is there anything else I might help you with?


No, thank you for the advice.
Don't worry about me.
I'll keep that in mind.
Too bad for them.
Sorry to bother you.
None of your business.
Hello there [[ms]brother[fs]sister]. {^n}{^n}You look lost. Is there something I can help you with?{^n}{^n}Perhaps you have some questions I might answer?


No thank you.
Hi there.{^n}{^n}You look lost. Is there something I can help you with?
Who is the Emissary?
Well now, that is a good question.{^n}{^n}The Emissary has been in service of the Three for a very long time. Some say since the beginning, which would make him hundreds of years old.{^n}{^n}I don't know how much truth there is to that, but there is no doubt he has been one of their most fervent servants.{^n}{^n}He goes where the Three will not, recruiting talented individuals in their name or scouring them from existence should their refusal be perceived as a threat to the gods. I suspect many here were once recruited by him, including yours truly.
You were recruited by the Emissary?
Yes, I certainly was. {^n}{^n}It's not the happiest of tales, but all worked out in the end, I suppose.{^n}{^n}I was 14 at the time. My parents had fallen ill to a pox that claimed countless lives across the countryside.{^n}{^n}Things...were not looking good and we were running out of money. The little bit of medicine I could afford was quickly running out. One day, while I was out in the market trying to scrounge some coin for the meager goods we had, I began hearing voices, but they did not originate from anyone nearby. Only I could hear them.{^n}{^n}They told me things, things I thought impossible. At first, I was rightfully scared and didn't know what to make of it. I thought I was going mad. But in them was wisdom, I just didn't know it at the time.{^n}{^n}It wasn't long before my mother succumbed to the pox. I had to bury her myself as father was still too weak. As tears streamed down my cheeks, I vowed to not let that happen again.{^n}{^n}I listened to the voices and through them learned tricks beyond mortal limits. I...hurt some people, but I was able to earn enough money for food and for father's medicine.{^n}{^n}The day father got out of bed for the first time in weeks, a stranger came to me on the road. A hood cloaked his features, and he introduced himself only as the Emissary. He told me that the voices I was hearing were not of my own failing sanity, but instead they were a gift.{^n}{^n}He told me that I was right to listen, but now the time had come to pay for my gifts. Father's life in exchange for my service. He said that I should keep listening to the voices, to follow them wherever they lead, but I will never see my father again. To deny them was to deny the call of a god.{^n}{^n}I felt that I had no choice. I wrote father a note and left in the middle of the night. The Emissary was not wrong. The voices led me to Stonereach, a coven of witches in the service of the Three. There I honed my powers and embraced my calling.{^n}{^n}I do not know what happened to father, but given what's happened across Cairn, I can only imagine; and I can only imagine I'd have shared his fate if I didn't leave.

That's...quite a story.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks for the information.
Interesting.
What is this place?
This is a gathering of those faithful to the Three. A convergence of powers this world has not yet seen.{^n}{^n}All of us were called here, much like you were.
The Three?
Are you really that out of your element?{^n}{^n}The Three...the Witch Gods...Bysmiel, Dreeg and Solael.{^n}{^n}The very reasons why we stand here this day.{^n}{^n}We are, all of us, bound to their will. To serve them is to have purpose.{^n}{^n}And now you have been called into their service as well.


Thank you for your help.
That's great. See you later.
What are we doing here?
Each of us has our role to play, but all of us are here because the Three demanded it.{^n}{^n}A forgotten threat rises to the north, one that may consume this land if we falter or delay.{^n}{^n}There are some in this camp who are skeptical of this, but they are fools to question the gods.{^n}{^n}The threat is real as we will all know it soon enough.

Who are the Three?
Ok, I'll keep that in mind.
Farewell.
Thanks for the information.
I'm fine, but thanks.
I was just leaving.
