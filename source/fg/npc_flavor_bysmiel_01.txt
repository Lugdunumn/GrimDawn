I see that your loyalty does not lie with Bysmiel. Even so you must not take your pledge lightly.{^n}{^n}The Three expect a great deal from their followers.

I'll keep that in mind.
An Inquisitor pledging their loyalty to Bysmiel. I never thought I'd see the day.{^n}{^n}I don't mind telling you, this pledge you've made is not something to be taken lightly.{^n}{^n}The Three expect a great deal from their followers.

I'll keep that in mind.
I don't have time for this, witch.
Welcome [[ms]brother[fs]sister]. I hear you've made a pledge to our lady Bysmiel. {^n}{^n}This is a noble thing to do. Though I'm sure you know Bysmiel expects a great deal from her followers.
And what does she expect from you, sister?
I'll keep that in mind, sister.
Yes, I know.
So, I hear you've pledged your loyalty to Bysmiel. This is not a thing to be taken lightly. {^n}{^n}The Three expect a great deal from their followers.
And what do they expect from you?
From me? {^n}{^n}Well that is a long story.
I'm all ears.
Well, the simple answer is; I collect ancient things, relics and runes.{^n}{^n}How I get them and what I do with them is where it gets a bit more complex.{^n}{^n}There is a very powerful connection between this place and the realms beyond. The Three wish to take advantage of this. That is where I come in.{^n}{^n}My duty is to learn as much as possible about the civilization that once thrived here by studying what they left behind.
How do you get these relics?
By any means necessary, really.{^n}{^n}There are just so many tombs and temples to be explored and we know so little about the people who once lived here that I do not shy to acquire outside assistance.{^n}{^n}Travelers willing to part with their finds. Fools unaware of the treasures they hold.{^n}{^n}And of course then I have my loyal thralls...{^n}{^n}I had a trio, brothers, scrounging the nearby ruins, but it seems something has happened to two of them and the third refuses to work as a result.
What do you do with the relics you find?
Thank you for speaking with me.
So you're a grave robber.
What do you do with these relics?
Well, that is where things get interesting.{^n}{^n}I was selected for this task thanks to my talent for deciphering ancient languages and runes. {^n}{^n}Many of the objects we find are simple and have no real value, but a small number of them have historical significance or even magical properties.{^n}{^n}When I find such an object, I must first determine its nature. Some of them were intentionally crafted, some of them gained their properties through more nefarious means, some can be quite dangerous. I use various spells and incantations, sometimes enlisting the help of the Dreeg seers, to determine the origin and nature of each artifact.{^n}{^n}When I feel that I understand an object well enough, I attempt to use it, on others if necessary.{^n}{^n}With varying results, as you may imagine.{^n}{^n}Thralls serve many uses after all.{^n}{^n}*Nika grins*
Sounds dangerous.
You cannot imagine.{^n}{^n}I've lost my fair share of thralls, and brothers and sisters who were too careless toying with artifacts they did not understand.{^n}{^n}The risk of injury or even death is always there, but that is part of the thrill.
What happens after you test them?
Keep up the good work.
Try not to get killed.
Then what?
Well, to be quite frank, inquisitor, you should be all too familiar with what happens to dangerous artifacts.{^n}{^n}It is a search for knowledge and power...a race even.{^n}{^n}We seek to uncover the secrets of the past so that we might unlock them before they fall into the hands of our adversaries.{^n}{^n}Many of whom are Luminari, like yourself.{^n}{^n}There are those who would use such information for the misfortune of us all, as I'm sure you're aware.{^n}{^n}We may have chosen different paths, but the Luminari and the cult of Bysmiel are not all that different.{^n}{^n}In the end, we just serve different masters.

I suppose that's true.
I don't think so witch.
Well, to be quite frank, it is a search for knowledge and power...a race even.{^n}{^n}We seek to uncover the secrets of the past so that we might unlock them before they fall into the hands of our adversaries.{^n}{^n}There are those who would use such information for the misfortune of us all, as I'm sure you're aware.{^n}{^n}Instead, the relics serve the purposes of the Three, and we are justly rewarded.

I see.
Keep up the good work sister.

That's interesting.
 I need to go.
We can finish this later.
I don't have time for this.
Perhaps another time.
I'll keep that in mind.
It seems you've passed the test, congratulations.{^n}{^n}Think carefully about your next move. Choosing to serve one of the Three is no small thing.
Whom do you serve?
I am a humble and lifelong servant of Bysmiel.{^n}{^n}But this was a choice that was made for me. Not all are as fortunate as you.{^n}{^n}Though I am thankful for the life my service has provided me.
The choice was made for you?
In a way yes.{^n}{^n}When I was very young I answered the call.{^n}{^n}The Schemer came to me in a dream and showed me what my life would be in her service. {^n}{^n}I had never felt such purpose before. I knew then that I must serve Bysmiel. I left home and began searching for clues to her grand web.{^n}{^n}So you could say my decision was made for me. Bysmiel called and I answered.
That's interesting.
Thanks for sharing.
That's interesting.
I don't have time to talk right now.
Thanks.
Welcome [[ms]brother[fs]sister]. The Emissary spoke of your arrival. {^n}{^n}I believe he's waiting for you.
Thank you.
I'll go find him.
Hello there stranger.{^n}{^n}You had better go speak with the Emissary before you go wandering around the camp.
I'll go wherever I please.
I'll go find him.
I'm sorry, stranger{^n}{^n}Perhaps we can talk later.
Ok.
See you later.
