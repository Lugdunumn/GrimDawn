Kanatha, Mistress of the Sentinels
The screams we heard from the temple were glorious, simply glorious!{^n}{^n}My sentinels will scour this land of the heretics until what was once forgotten is once more...forgotten.{^n}{^n}As the Three will it.
Good luck with the hunt.
Farewell.
My sentinels are ready.{^n}{^n}Let the blood of our enemies flow and the fires in their heretic hearts be quenched upon our blades!
Farewell.
The Emissary was right, as usual.{^n}{^n}You have earned the right to stand among us in the real trials to come.
What is your role here?
By the blessing of the Covenant, I am the Mistress of the Sentinels.{^n}{^n}Those sworn to guard the interests of the Three and the survival of our people answer to me.{^n}{^n}They swear their oaths to the gods, and to me, just as you have made an unbreakable oath that guides your existence.

Goodbye.

What trials await us?
Goodbye.
And what trials are those?
Our battle against the fiery fury boiling beneath the sands, of course.{^n}{^n}A forgotten god stirs, an ancient enemy of mankind threatens to destroy us all.{^n}{^n}We must rise to face this threat before all is lost.

I see.
Of course I did.
Farewell.
Don't stray too far now.{^n}{^n}Know your place or I'll have you get acquainted with my sentinels.
Alright.
The Emissary warned me of your coming.{^n}{^n}But whether you may remain here is not a matter of his choosing.{^n}{^n}I will decide who stays...and who dies.{^n}{^n}Are you prepared to face the trials?
Let's get this over with. (Begin Eldritch Trials)
I'm not ready yet.
What are these trials?
Save your questions for the scholars.{^n}{^n}If you are to survive out here, then you must be tested against the terrors of the Eldritch Realm.{^n}{^n}Are you prepared to begin or not?
I'm ready. (Begin Eldritch Trials)
I'm not ready yet.

What is your role here?
Right now, my role here is to determine whether you are worth the risks of bringing into our fold.{^n}{^n}Now are you ready to begin or not?
I'm ready. (Begin Eldritch Trials)
I'm not ready yet.

Don't stray too far now.{^n}{^n}Speak to the Emissary or I'll be certain you get acquainted with my sentinels.
Alright.
