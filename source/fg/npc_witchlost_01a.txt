Elita
It's good to see you again. {^n}{^n}You really saved our hides out there.
I'm glad I could help.
I don't know what we could ever do to repay you.{^n}{^n}If you ever need anything please feel free to ask.
Actually, I have some questions.
Sure, what is it?
What can you tell me about the Witch Gods?
Honestly, there's more stories about them than I could tell you in a lifetime, than I even know myself.{^n}{^n}The Three defy comprehension. Legends say that they were mortal once, just as you and I, but they had become so much more.{^n}{^n}We are all drawn to their power, hoping for a small taste of their gifts, but they do not give freely.{^n}{^n}So we pledge ourselves to them, sacrifice for them, kill for them.{^n}{^n}The strongest among us rise, the weak are purged.
I see.
Who are Byscilla, Dreaellus and Sagon?
They speak the will of the Witch Gods, they embody the very word of the Three.{^n}{^n}To defy them is to defy the gods.{^n}{^n}Everyone you see here was at some point summoned by their command.{^n}{^n}Some, such as yourself, were visited by the Emissary. Others heard the call from countless covens and hiding places across Cairn.{^n}{^n}I had never met them in person before I arrived here, but I can tell you that their connection to the Three is undeniably powerful.
I have another question.

Interesting.
What do you know about the rift at the center of camp?
Now that is a good question, one that may be better served for Mazaan.{^n}{^n}I've had my eye on that rift since I got here.{^n}{^n}From what I've heard, it sounds like no place for someone like me, but supposedly it holds treasures untold.{^n}{^n}They say it is a gateway to the realm of an ancient and powerful god.{^n}{^n}A god who was banished by the very people who worshiped him. Its name is now lost to time.Whatever happened, the god appears to be no more, its realm shattered like a pane of glass into an infinite number of interconnected shards.{^n}{^n}Sounds pretty interesting, if you ask me.{^n}{^n}But I couldn't even manage a trip through the desert without your help so I suppose I have no business going through that portal.{^n}{^n}If you go in there, you'll have to tell me what it was like.
It was like our world, and yet not.
Oh, remarkable.{^n}{^n}It's as if this god created a realm to reflect our own, or perhaps ours is a reflection of this other reality.{^n}{^n}Whichever's the case, I guess ours is the one that endured, but now I wonder what would happen if the very gods that forged our reality cease to exist?
It's a troubling thought.
I'd rather not think about it.
We don't need gods.
I have another question.

I will.
Nevermind.
I will.
I'll remember that.
It was no problem.
You'll have to excuse me, I should be cataloging these supplies.
Enjoy that.
Farewell.
