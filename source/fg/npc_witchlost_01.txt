Elita
Help us, please.{^n}{^n}We need to get out of here.
Don't worry, help is on the way.
Oh, thank the Three, you got here just in time.{^n}{^n}Those things had us cornered.{^n}{^n}Listen, we're in no condition to continue but we need to get out of here.{^n}{^n}Do you think you could help us?
I've been looking for you. Keisen sent me.
I knew they wouldn't just leave us out here.{^n}{^n}We need to get back, but we can't just leave our supplies here. That would...be frowned upon.{^n}{^n}If we come back without these supplies, we might as well slit our own throats.
I can open a rift and send you back with your supplies.

I'll be back for you.
I'll be back for you.

Where will you go?
We need to get these supplies back to the Conclave.{^n}{^n}But there's no way we're going to make it out there.{^n}{^n}Do you have some way of getting us all out of here safely?
I can open a rift and send you there.
Is that any safer given what roams the Eldritch Realm?{^n}{^n}You know what, it doesn't matter. {^n}{^n}Do whatever you need to, whatever it takes to get us out of here..
Here you go. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be back for you.
I'll be back for you.
