Daila Thornsbury
Thank you for bringing me the pendant.{^n}{^n}It...offers a degree of closure.
Where will you go from here?
Just as Dravis was driven by rage burning within him, I felt a purpose in this hunt that I hadn't sensed in a long time.{^n}{^n}But that is over now. I will travel back to Homestead, see my little girl again.{^n}{^n}I'm not sure I can ever fully return to that life though. I hope Oliver will understand.
Good luck out there, Daila.
Farewell, Daila.
Good luck out there, Daila.
Farewell, Daila.
I have to say, I was not expecting to find you here, so far from Erulan.{^n}{^n}My hunt has led me to the Korvan Basin. Dravis is close, I can feel it.{^n}{^n}He will not evade me this time.
I think I have something of yours.
Then I am already too late.{^n}{^n}I hadn't seen this pendant in decades. Father would never part with this, unless?
I'm...sorry, he is dead.
I...had a feeling. A discomfort in the back of my mind.{^n}{^n}He confronted Dravis, and he gave his life to stop the madness he had seeded within his child all those years ago.{^n}{^n}But what of Dravis...did he survive? Or do I have a part to play in this still?
Dravis too lies dead.
Oh...I will not deny I am feeling conflicted.{^n}{^n}A part of me yearned for another meeting between us, but I am also glad it's over.{^n}{^n}Dravis had become consumed by vengeance and power. It is for the best.{^n}{^n}What's done is done. I thank you for bringing this pendant to me.{^n}{^n}It offers some closure regarding my father, even if it isn't the closure I wanted.

Good luck out there, Daila.
Farewell, Daila.
I think I have something of yours.
Then I am already too late.{^n}{^n}I hadn't seen this pendant in decades. Father would never part with this, unless?
I'm afraid I don't know what happened.
That's perhaps for the best.{^n}{^n}Any confrontation between those two was bound to be catastrophic.{^n}{^n}What's done is done. I thank you for bringing this to me.{^n}{^n}It offers some closure regarding my father, even if it isn't the closure I wanted.

Good luck out there, Daila.
Farewell, Daila.
We'll talk later, Daila.
I have to say, I was not expecting to find you here, so far from Erulan.{^n}{^n}My hunt has led me to the Korvan Basin. Dravis is close, I can feel it.{^n}{^n}He will not evade me this time.
How did you track Dravis here?
Do you remember the flower he left me?{^n}{^n}It is native to this region. A very rare bloom indeed.{^n}{^n}Dravis wanted me to come here. But why...{^n}{^n}He isn't far though, so I'll be asking him that myself soon enough...at the tip of a blade.

Good luck.
Farewell.
What's your plan?
The Korvan Basin is a vast region, but Dravis is driven by two things: power...and our father's head.{^n}{^n}I strongly suspect he's headed towards what remains of Korvan City.{^n}{^n}If you find yourself headed there. Be careful. Dravis should not be underestimated.

I'll keep an eye out.
Farewell.
We'll talk later, Daila.
Don't you have someplace better to be?
I suppose I do.
