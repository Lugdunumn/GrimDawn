Inarah, the Afflicted
Do you hear the whispers too?
I think I'll be going now.
Do you hear the whispers too?{^n}{^n}They come, from all sides, and within. We are doomed, all of us doomed.{^n}{^n}The Great Eye is blind to the calamity of blood. Founts of blood and the dead lips that drink their fill.
Inarah, listen to me. You're not well.
Well? Who is truly well in this broken world?{^n}{^n}Ishtal has whispered to me truths which we cannot comprehend.{^n}{^n}The gods will not listen, but I have gleaned beyond the tapestry and seen the lies beneath.{^n}{^n}We will all drown in blood. The wound must be seared by fire if any are to live.
Ishtal is manipulating you. You have to cast him out!
You will lay no harm upon us.{^n}{^n}The choir of madness has been silenced. I only hear one voice now.{^n}{^n}And that voice demands fire!
I'm sorry, I have no choice. (Attack)
There's no hope for you. (Attack)
I'm sorry, I have no choice. (Attack)
Do you hear the whispers too?
I think I'll be going now.
