Seer Laurna
What can I help you with?
What can you tell me about the Messenger?
Folk tales would describe a fiery visage coming to people in their dreams or in times of desperation, offering them salvation and solace from their life's woes.{^n}{^n}Its presence is said to precede great disaster, but perhaps that is the excuse given by those committed to horrible deeds in the name of Korvaak.{^n}{^n}It is through this Messenger that Korvaak spread its vile lies and ensnared the souls of Father Kymon and his desperate followers. But the beast is banished now, for what it's worth, thanks to you.
Before, you said something about it possibly returning?
Indeed, death may not have been the end of this foul spawn.{^n}{^n}Perhaps it is its connection to the forgotten god that allows it to endure; or perhaps it is rage manifest, such purity of raw emotion that it wills itself to endure beyond mortal wounds.{^n}{^n}Its powerful influence over the minds of mortals is of grave concern. If the Messenger endured, then it may use this power to manipulate mortals and orchestrate its return.
Maybe so.
No, I destroyed it.
Indeed.
Be careful what you mess with.
Nothing right now.
Sorry, come back another time.
Another time then.
Is it done, have you slain the Messenger?
The Messenger is dead.
You've banished the Messenger?{^n}{^n}Then why do I still sense its presence? Why does its fury still cloud my visions?{^n}{^n}Perhaps it cannot truly be killed, at least not by any means known to us.{^n}{^n}I believe you, but there may be something we don't know about this being.{^n}{^n}I'm concerned that this is not the end to its malice.
I'm pretty sure it's dead.
I trust you. You seem certain that you killed it.{^n}{^n}But death may not be the end of this foul creation of Korvaak.{^n}{^n}Perhaps it is its connection to the forgotten god that allows it to endure; or perhaps it is rage manifest, such purity of raw emotion that it wills itself to endure beyond mortal wounds.{^n}{^n}I must discuss this with the elder seers.{^n}{^n}Thank you again for assisting in this matter. For now at least, we can consider it settled.

I do what I can.
I'm sure that thing is dead.
I did what you asked.
Back so soon?
What am I supposed to be doing again?
The malevolent spawn of Korvaak sits within the Pit of Atonement, an active volcano within the ruins of Korvan City to the northwest, beyond the Infernal Wastes.{^n}{^n}Seek it out, destroy it. The weave of fate demands it be so.
I'll get it done.
I'll be going back out there soon.
If it isn't the intrepid traveler.{^n}{^n}I've had my mind on you for some time now. Your exploits here and beyond have proven to be very favorable to the Three.{^n}{^n}But another vision has clouded my mind as of late and I think you may be able to help me.
What is it?
I have peered into the veil and what looked back was sheer malevolence.{^n}{^n}The being I speak of is known only as the Messenger, a powerful servant of Korvaak.{^n}{^n}Folk tales would describe a fiery visage coming to people in their dreams or in times of desperation, offering them salvation and solace from their life's woes. It is this harbinger of Korvaak's fiery wrath that bound the foolish Kymon's Chosen to the forgotten god's will. Why it has chosen to reveal itself now is unknown to me, but this is an opportunity we cannot pass up.{^n}{^n}Eliminating the Messenger would be a critical blow to Korvaak's forces. You must follow my vision to the place of misery known as the Pit of Atonement. It is an active volcano within the ruins of Korvan City to the northwest, beyond the Infernal Wastes.{^n}{^n}There the Messenger awaits us. Seek it out, destroy it. The weave of fate demands it be so.
I'll see that it is done.
It will have to wait.
The Messenger is already dead.

Sorry, not right now.
Excuse me, I don't have time to talk right now.
Ok.
That's too bad.
