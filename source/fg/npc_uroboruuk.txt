Uroboruuk
*Uroboruuk looks at you silently*
Goodbye.
*Uroboruuk looks at you silently*
Goodbye.
I've witnessed the passing of centuries, but now I find myself wishing I had more time.
Can you bring down the barrier?
When Dravis confronted me at the temple steps, I saw the madness consuming his soul, but I also saw the anguish that I had wrought upon it.{^n}{^n}Dravis was unwilling to listen to reason. I erected the barrier so that he could not enter the tomb by any means, but I could not bring myself to strike down my own child.{^n}{^n}Now my powers are nearly spent. The souls flowing through my veins seek their release. I sense that my time has finally come.{^n}{^n}It appears that you and I had similar goals. The evils within this tomb must not be set free.{^n}{^n}I will lower my barrier.{^n}{^n}Enter the Tomb of the Eldritch Sun and complete my task. Vanquish the darkness and bring a momentary peace to Cairn.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
Hold on just a moment longer.
I have so many questions.
I will answer what I can in the short time that we have.
The Order's been looking for you, master.
A foolish errand and a waste of time. My purpose there had been served.{^n}{^n}The ancient art has been restored.{^n}{^n}The Order no longer requires my guidance.{^n}{^n}Sealing the evils of this tomb was to be my final act, the end to centuries of anguish.{^n}{^n}To stand at the cusp of my journey only to fail...our existence certainly has a taste for cruelty.

May I ask another question?
I need a moment to think.
Are you the Uroboruuk I've heard about?
The stories about me have no doubt become muddled with legends over the centuries, but yes, I am one and the same.{^n}{^n}Sealing the evils of this tomb was to be my final act, the end to centuries of anguish.{^n}{^n}To stand at the cusp of my journey only to fail...our existence certainly has a taste for cruelty.

May I ask another question?
I need a moment to think.
Who are you?
I am the one they call Uroboruuk.{^n}{^n}For a time, I was the last living master of the necromantic arts, but through my Order of Death's Vigil, I saw its study restored.{^n}{^n}I endured for centuries, but my time is nearly up. Sealing the evils of this tomb was to be my final act, the end to my anguish.{^n}{^n}To stand at the cusp of my journey only to fail...our existence certainly has a taste for cruelty.

What happened in Arkovia?
*Uroboruuk stares past you into the distance*{^n}{^n}Hm, Arkovia...perhaps my most troubling legacy.{^n}{^n}*Uroboruuk's eyes snap back to you*{^n}{^n}It was a land of opulence, of a people obsessed with pursuits of the flesh. Their oligarchs were consumed with consolidating their authority at any cost, even if it meant the downfall of their nation.{^n}{^n}I lived in Arkovia for a time. I bore witness to atrocities committed against my kind in the name of justice and keeping of the peace. Eventually they came for me as well.{^n}{^n}I was brought to the despicable tomb prison they called the Steps of Torment and left to the whims of their chief executioner, Alkamos. When they discovered I could not die, the tortures they imparted upon me pushed the limits of human imagination.{^n}{^n}Naturally, this drew the attention of the oligarchs, who hungered for my immortality. They demanded I show them, but I refused. And so I was put to renewed torture, day and night without rest.{^n}{^n}In the end, I relented, in a way. They thought me broken, defeated, but it was a mere ruse. I was finished with the Arkovians and their depravity. They would all suffer a thousand-fold for the torment I endured.{^n}{^n}I gave them their immortality and cursed their progeny for all time, then as they were distracted by their twisted gift, I made my escape. They would not discover the nature of my curse for some time, but by then I was long gone.{^n}{^n}Arkovia bears the weight of my hubris to this day. An entire people wiped out by my hand for the actions of a few.

I need a moment to think.
Why did you leave the Order of Death's Vigil?
Having achieved my goals, the time had come for me to move on. The Order no longer requires my guidance, even if they do not yet see it.{^n}{^n}The stirring of ancient gods and the machinations of their banished servants had captured my attention, and so I set out to discover the source of these disturbances.{^n}{^n}But I was too late to stop what the people now call the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}I fear we may be too late to stop Kymon and his god as well. But that falls to you now.

May I ask another question?
I need a moment to think.
If Dravis was your son...then Daila...
I fathered many children. Few of them ever knew me as Dravis and Daila did, and even they did not know much.{^n}{^n}Such attachments breed only agony.{^n}{^n}I slighted Daila as I did Dravis but, unlike him, she sought to forgive.{^n}{^n}She was a daughter I did not deserve.

May I ask another question?
You abandoned your children?
If you endure enough lifetimes, emotional attachments start to lose all meaning.{^n}{^n}As I sought to atone for my sins, I believed myself above the concerns of mortals.{^n}{^n}Perhaps I was simply too afraid of loss. But who can withstand watching their children die as you outlive them time and again?

May I ask another question?

I need a moment to think.
You lived for centuries?
Yes, I've witnessed the rise of empires and their inevtiable fall. I played no small part in one of them.{^n}{^n}I was there when the gods grew silent and the world was left to the machinations of mortals and ascendants.{^n}{^n}But this is no gift. I paid a dark price for this cursed existence.

May I ask another question?
You mean Arkovia?

How did you do it?
Do you hope to replicate my rituals?{^n}{^n}I performed unthinkable acts, sacrificed others for my own gains. I still hear their anguished cries within me when I close my eyes.{^n}{^n}Immortality was mine, so long as I was willing to repeat my mistakes. Lifetimes of guilt had eroded my arrogance, however.{^n}{^n}My most recent ritual laid unused, that is until Dravis stumbled upon it and achieved partial success.

May I ask another question?

I need a moment to think.
What brought you here?
I wished to atone for my sins by putting my skills to the only purpose they serve...destruction.{^n}{^n}A threat is rising beneath these sands and I sought to extinguish it.

May I ask another question?
I need a moment to think.
Nevermind, what about the barrier?
Nevermind. I'll be right back.
I need a moment to think.
And so my misguided child lies dead, far from the land of his birth.{^n}{^n}I've witnessed many of my progeny perish over the centuries, such is the curse of my existence, but none stung as much as this.{^n}{^n}I thought myself above his pain, that my pursuit of atonement superseded his naive ignorance.{^n}{^n}I see now that I was wrong. In my hubris, I created a monster, the force of my own undoing.
Dravis was too far gone.
He was consumed by his hatred for me. In another life, perhaps he would have stood by my side as we sealed this tomb forever.{^n}{^n}I'm afraid now that duty falls to another.{^n}{^n}*Uroboruuk scoffs*{^n}{^n}I've witnessed the passing of centuries, but now I find myself wishing I had more time.


I'll be back.
I'll be right back.
You...have to...stop Dravis.{^n}{^n}My barrier will not hold for long.
What's happening here?
Now is not the time...{^n}{^n}Stop...Dravis...

Alright, I will.
This isn't my fight.
Wait, are you Uroboruuk?
Now is not the time...{^n}{^n}Stop...Dravis...

Alright, I will.
This isn't my fight.
Alright, I will.
This isn't my fight.
*Uroboruuk looks at you silently*
Goodbye.
