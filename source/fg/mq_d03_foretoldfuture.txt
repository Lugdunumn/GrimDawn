The Eldritch Sun
A Future Foretold
A Vision of Hopelessness
Many in the Dreeg camp are gripped by visions of a hopelessness, of things dear to them destroyed and defiled by the Forgotten God.{^n}{^n}Draellus believes these visions are no coincidence, nor do they prophesy an inevitable future. They may well be a weapon wielded by the servants of the Forgotten God, aimed at driving dissent among worshipers of the three.{^n}{^n}Draellus has asked you to enter his vision of this dark future and seek out the creature at its root.{^n}{^n}Perhaps eliminating this fiend will grant some relief to the afflicted.{^n}{^n}Enter the rift opened by Draellus at the Vanguard of the Three and deal with whatever you find inside.


Slay the the Mind Reaper

Return to Draellus
The creature at the root of the dark visions has been eliminated, but the future you witnessed seemed all too real.{^n}{^n}Is this to be the world under the reign of Korvaak? The possibility only makes victory in the battle ahead that much more critical.{^n}{^n}Report back to Draellus at the Vanguard of the Three.
