Byscilla, Matron of Rifts
Don't worry, I'll be well aware of your every move. You need not come tell me yourself.
Um, sure.
If you say so.
What a curiosity.{^n}{^n}You and I must speak another time.
Farewell.
What a bother.{^n}{^n}Move along, child.
Fine.
The web is spun. Everything is set in motion as I've planned.{^n}{^n}What are you still doing here?
What do I need to do again?
Our primordial foe stirs within the Tomb of the Eldritch Sun, beyond the Infernal Wastes.{^n}{^n}Seal its fate and spare Cairn another cataclysmic event.


Alright.
Why is this god such a threat exactly?
You have no doubt seen the devastation wrought by his rage, the smoldering ruins, the very earth ripped apart in molten agony.{^n}{^n}Imagine what he would do if he were free of that tomb. Bysmiel's web would be a sad affair with no one left alive to exact her will.


Fair enough.
What of the Witch Gods? We could use their aid.
Do not presume to know better than Bysmiel where she is needed.{^n}{^n}You have your part to play and the gods have theirs.


Fair enough.
I've misplaced the sigil.
*The sigil appears over Byscilla's extended hand*{^n}{^n}My web has already seen to your error. Do not be so careless with such a precious relic.
I'll be more careful.
Um, on my way.
Farewell.
The hour of our victory has come.{^n}{^n}Our work from the shadows is finished, now we must see this through.
What is the plan?
The Witch Gods are united in this endeavor. All of our forces stand at the ready to assault the Tomb of the Eldritch Sun and breach its gates.{^n}{^n}Join them on the battlefield, decimate any that would stand in our way.{^n}{^n}Travel north, beyond the Infernal Wastes and into the remains of Korvan City. Ascend the steps to the tomb and make your way inside. Within lies a secret chamber with the power to breach the veil itself.{^n}{^n}Take this sigil. It will open the way to the primordial one's hiding place. Enter the rift and bring an end to this grave threat.
I'm ready to lead the assault.
I need time to prepare.
What about you?
The...Schemer's web demands my utmost attention. I will play my part, but not on the frontlines.{^n}{^n}Vengeance shall be yours alone, but I shall be watching.
I'm ready to lead the assault.
I need time to prepare.


What was the plan again?

What was the plan again?
We'll speak of this soon.
What a wonderfully thoughtful gift you've brought me.{^n}{^n}Just what I've been asking for.
Are you satisfied then?
Mmm, yes, but don't think of it as some selfish endeavor.{^n}{^n}This delightful creature will join you on the frontlines. Its claws will rip into the throats of the forgotten one's servants and spill their lifeblood in Bysmiel's name.{^n}{^n}*Byscilla closes her eyes and smiles*
So, do we have a plan?

Well? Where is my plaything?
What do I need to do again?
Hm, that simply will not do.{^n}{^n}Travel north to the Valley of the Chosen and enter the Temple of Ateph.{^n}{^n}Within stands an altar. Use the Gargan Key upon it and bind a minion to my will.{^n}{^n}Let no one stand in your way!
Alright.
I lost the Gargan Key.
So I've heard.{^n}{^n}Don't be so careless with it this time.
I'll be more careful.
I'm working on it.
You've gathered the materials and the power we need.{^n}{^n}Now it is time for my favorite part.
And what's that?
With the materials you've brought me, I have conjured what's known as the Gargan Key.{^n}{^n}It is an arcane device used by the people that lived here long ago. Its purpose? The summoning of eldritch creatures within the Temple of Ateph.{^n}{^n}Travel north, to the Valley of the Chosen. Seek out the temple and find the altar within. There the veil is thin and your chances of success highest.{^n}{^n}Let nothing stand in your way, not the primordial one's brainwashed fools, not the temple's defenses. Activate the altar and bind me a worthy minion!
I'll do as you ask.
This doesn't sound like a job for me.
Alain was quite pleased with your performance. But now it is my turn.{^n}{^n}You've gathered the materials and the power we need. It is time for my favorite part.
And what's that?

What a bother.{^n}{^n}Move along, child.
Fine.
