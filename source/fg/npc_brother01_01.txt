I have to be honest, this is all very strange. I don't really know how this is happening, the thing with the ghost.{^n}{^n}I suppose I don't really care.{^n}{^n}That thing...my brother. He's as much Anderan as he was when he was alive.{^n}{^n}I'm just glad to have him back.
What is Anderan's ghost doing here?
You're asking me?{^n}{^n}I have no idea. I've heard stories about people raising the dead or summoning ancient spirits. But I've never heard of anything like this before.{^n}{^n}When he first arrived, I thought the witches were playing some sort of cruel joke; but then Aaral just started in like nothing had happened.{^n}{^n}Watching the two of them argue with each other like they did before he...died, is odd to say the least.
I bet it is.
Good luck with that.
What's next for the three of you?
The two of them are talking about going back to work.{^n}{^n}Aaral seems to think we can use Anderan's new...situation, to our benefit.{^n}{^n}It certainly will make getting in and out of those old rat holes easier. {^n}{^n}Nika is eager to get us back out there, digging through the tombs, and I can't say no to that woman.{^n}{^n}But it just doesn't seem right. Honestly, the whole thing doesn't seem right.{^n}{^n}Thanks again for your help though.

I do what I can.
Good luck out there.
It's rather unusual, I admit.
Farewell.
Sorry, I can't talk.{^n}{^n}I'm waiting for someone.
Maybe later.
Thank you for bringing my brothers back.{^n}{^n}What's left of them.
I'm glad I could help.

Farewell.
I spoke with Aaral, if Anderan is stuck down in that temple you've got to go down there and find him, please.{^n}{^n}That kid is as strong as a chillmane but he's not much smarter than a rock.{^n}{^n}If he is down there he's going to need your help.
Where's the temple again?
There are ruins below the Cairan Docks to the north.{^n}{^n}That's where you found Aaral.
I'm on my way.
I'll find him.
I'll see what I can do.
I haven't heard anything from my brothers.{^n}{^n}Have you been out to the Cairan Docks yet? {^n}{^n}Any word of them?
What do you need me to do again?
My brothers, they're lost out there somewhere.{^n}{^n}You said you'd help me find them. {^n}{^n}The last I saw them was outside a temple near the Cairan Docks.
Ok, I'll keep an eye out for them.
Working on it.
Traveler, can you spare a minute?{^n}{^n}You look like you might be able to help me.
Sure, what do you need?
It's my brothers. I was supposed to meet them back here last night but they haven't shown up yet. {^n}{^n}We split up yesterday morning outside the Cairan Docks, to the north.{^n}{^n}There's a temple under the ruins there, they couldn't leave it alone, just had to go for one more. The two of them just can't control themselves.{^n}{^n}Who am I fooling? I would have been right there with them but I was already loaded up with as much as I could carry. {^n}{^n}I told them to meet me back here. That was the last I heard of either of them. I'd go back out there and look for them myself but I should stay here in case they come back.{^n}{^n}If you're headed out past the wall will you keep an eye out for them? {^n}{^n}They've got to be somewhere between here and the Cairan Docks.
I'll find your brothers.
I don't have time right now.
I don't have the time right now.
Sorry, I can't talk.{^n}{^n}I'm waiting for someone.
Maybe later.
