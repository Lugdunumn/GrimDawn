Atrin
I'm sorry, are you the one we're supposed to see for our initiation?
I'm afraid not.
We've been instructed to wait here for our initiation.{^n}{^n}I don't suppose that's why you're here?
Yes, that's why I'm here.
We're prepared for whatever you throw at us.{^n}{^n}Whatever it takes to earn our rightful place in Solael's ring.{^n}{^n}So, what will it be? Slaying some beast? A battle of wits?{^n}{^n}Or...?
You will prove your battle prowess to me.
Oh, I wasn't expecting to fight people.{^n}{^n}But if that's what it takes.{^n}{^n}Alright, we're ready.
Prepare yourself. (Attack)
Not just yet.
Not just yet.
I'm sorry, are you the one we're supposed to see for our initiation?
I don't believe so.
Ah, sorry then.{^n}{^n}Let's talk another time.
Well then, carry on.
Ok then.
I need to go.
