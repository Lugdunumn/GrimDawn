Mazaan, Keeper of Portals
Well done, this portion of the Shattered Realm is clear of threats and its power ours for the taking.{^n}{^n}I can open the way further or, if you wish, offer you compensation for your efforts. That will mark the end of your journey, however, as the connection to this Shard shall be broken.{^n}{^n}What will it be?
I must delve deeper! (Proceed to the next Shard)
Enough, I wish to claim my reward!
