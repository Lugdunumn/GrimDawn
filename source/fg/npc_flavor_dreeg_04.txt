Nailene, Seer of Dreeg
Have we met, stranger?{^n}{^n}Have we danced upon the strands of fate as one?
Yes, you were rambling on like a crazy person.
Yes, I recognize your face.{^n}{^n}I could see you before and hear you in my dreams, but my mind was clouded by overwhelming visions, horrible sights.{^n}{^n}Violence and suffering like you cannot imagine.{^n}{^n}I could not steer my mind away from them. All paths led back to the nightmare.{^n}{^n}It was as if my eyes were the eyes of millions, seeing a million ends, feeling their hopelessness without end.{^n}{^n}But then it suddenly stopped. And I cannot say why.
The Mind Reaper was controlling your visions.
The...Mind...Reaper?{^n}{^n}You mean to tell me these visions I saw...they were not mine?{^n}{^n}The flesh sighs in relief, but the mind is troubled. I am glad that such suffering is not to pass upon our weave, but who or what is this creature that can influence the sight?
It was an agent of Korvaak.
This news weighs upon the mind like needles.{^n}{^n}I offered myself before Dreeg, opened my soul to his gifts, and now they are tainted.{^n}{^n}To think for a fleeting moment that I could become a prisoner of untruths leaves me unsettled.
Well, the creature is dead.
It is dead? Its existence broken like the mirror of falsities it offered?{^n}{^n}That is a form of relief, but I am not sure it matters.{^n}{^n}If a creature can manipulate my sight in such a way, then others must exist as well.{^n}{^n}I cannot peer into the veil if what I see is a tapestry of lies.{^n}{^n}*Nailene looks away sadly*{^n}{^n}It is a horrible end, to squander the gifts of Dreeg, but how can I offer counsel through my visions if what I see truly is not what I see?
Hang in there.
If there's another one, we'll kill it too.
I don't believe so.
Nope.
*Nailene appears to be crying*
Are you alright?

Look at daddy, sweetheart.{^n}{^n}Just look at my eyes, don't look at the fire.{^n}{^n}Look at me and take my hand.
All shall burn as the Eldritch Sun rises upon this land.{^n}{^n}Fear and sorrow and pain, festering in the depths of the darkness, will wash over all creatures as his cleansing light brings with it a new day.
Please, you can't...{^n}{^n}They're just children.{^n}{^n}Oh please no.{^n}{^n}Please stop.
It burns.{^n}{^n}It burns.{^n}{^n}IT BURNS!
It's gone, all of it.{^n}{^n}All gone.{^n}{^n}I don't know how this is possible, it's as if it were never there.{^n}{^n}All those people, just gone.
When the Eldritch Sun rises nothing will stand against its glorious rays.{^n}{^n}All will be punished.{^n}{^n}All will submit to his will or burn in his cleansing light.
I've got you, ok?{^n}{^n}I won't let go, no matter what happens.{^n}{^n}Just remember that.
Just run...run and don't look back. {^n}{^n}RUN!
The city is burning, like the embers of an iron forge.{^n}{^n}I saw it with my own eyes.{^n}{^n}Heard the screams of thousands as they were eaten by liquid fire.{^n}{^n}Men, women, children all consumed like fodder for an insatiable herd.
What did they do with them?{^n}{^n}I told you, they ate them!{^n}{^n}Lying, I'm not lying. Who would lie about such a thing?{^n}{^n}I saw it with my own eyes.{^n}{^n}They ate them. The living, the dead...children. {^n}{^n}They ate the children, right where they slept.{^n}{^n}Mothers, fathers, entire families slaughtered without mercy.{^n}{^n}Slaughtered and fed to the living.
There is disease within the eye.{^n}{^n}Darkness that spreads like a storm, consuming the flesh, tainting the vision.{^n}{^n}It consumes those who see, cleanses them with eldritch fire.{^n}{^n}All who drink of its gifts shall burn and the Eldritch Sun will feed upon their final breath.
I smell the foul stench, a follower of the Forgotten God stands before us. It must be extinguished, it must be destroyed.
Excuse me?
Are you insane?
Yup, definitely crazy.
Um, okay...
