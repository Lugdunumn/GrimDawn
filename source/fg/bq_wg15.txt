Bounty: Korvan Titanovore
Bounty
During our research on the Korvan people, we uncovered tales of a massive, bloodthristy beast roaming the desert, consuming all in its path.{^n}{^n}These tales speak of the beast as if it were an ancient terror but there may be more truth to them than fiction. Recently, a group of scouts were attacked while exploring the outer reaches of the Korvan Sands. {^n}{^n}Only one of three survived and she described an attack much like those of Korvan folklore.{^n}{^n}If this beast is real it must be destroyed. Go to the Korvan Sands and hunt down the Korvan Titanovore.{^n}{^n}This is a highly dangerous task, which we will gladly compensate with rare scavenged materials.
