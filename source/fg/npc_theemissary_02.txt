The Emissary
You honor me with your presence.
What will the cults do now?
We must ensure that none of Korvaak's followers survive what happened here.{^n}{^n}If belief in Korvaak persists, then a spark of his being shall remain. We must snuff it out while we can.
But you said he will never again be a threat?
Korvaak will never again be a threat of the magnitude we faced this day, that I promise you.{^n}{^n}Without a vessel to contain his primordial form, his powers will wane and should he ever hope to return to Cairn, the Witch Gods will see to his demise.{^n}{^n}But if he is truly forgotten...

Then he will be no more.
I'm not feeling as confident as you.


Hunt them all down!
So this isn't truly over...
My part here is finished.
Korvaak said the Eldritch Realm was his. Why?
Do not think to believe the snake tongue of that being. It spreads naught but lies.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Realm is the domain of the Three. Now and forever.


Hm, I see.
Alright.
How old are you exactly?
Hm, let us just say that I was once a young priest in the service of Menhir, believing myself righteous; but my eyes were opened by the Witch Gods.{^n}{^n}When they forged their Covenant, I offered myself in service. My actions saw the cults flourish beneath the empire's gaze. For my accomplishments, I serve unto eternity.


Fascinating.
I see.
Farewell.
You stand upon sacred ground.{^n}{^n}Care where you step.
Farewell.
Korvaak's anguished cries have echoed across realities!
Yes, Korvaak is no more.
His cult has been crushed. Even now, his scattered followers are being hunted down and eliminated.{^n}{^n}The forgotten god will soon be a distant memory. Without a vessel, his powers will wane and he shall fade into nothingness.{^n}{^n}Never again will the people of Cairn have to fear for their lives at the mercy of Korvaak's fickle temper and destructive malevolence.{^n}{^n}Know that the Witch Gods are grateful for your sacrifice, even if they do not thank you in person. Wherever your journey leads next, their eyes will be upon you. Here, a prize from the gods themselves.


I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
I did what I had to.
The world is a little safer this day.
Wait, where is Sagon?
Hm, I'm afraid I do not know.{^n}{^n}I presume he had to do something on behalf of Solael himself.
Well, Korvaak is no more.
You presume to be the Emissary of the Three and do not know?
Who am I to question the will of the gods?{^n}{^n}Who are you to question them?
Well, Korvaak is no more.
Where did Draellus go?
Hm, I'm afraid I do not know.{^n}{^n}I presume he had to do something on behalf of Dreeg himself.
Well, Korvaak is no more.

Have you seen Byscilla?
Hm, I'm afraid not.{^n}{^n}I presume she had to do something on behalf of Bysmiel herself.
Well, Korvaak is no more.

The tomb is breached, the final seal awaits.{^n}{^n}Do what must be done!
I will.
The Great Eye is upon us this day. The preordained hour is at hand!{^n}{^n}Go forth in the name of the Three and leave nought but ashes in your wake!
Anything you can tell me about the Tomb of the Eldritch Sun?
Centuries ago, it was a place of worship, now it stands as the bastion of Korvaak's followers.{^n}{^n}Expect heavy resistance and assume nothing. The veil is thin there, eldritch anomalies will undoubtedly pierce through.
I thought the Eldritch Realm was the domain of the Three?
Hm, and it is, but the presence of Korvaak is threatening to undo all that they have created.{^n}{^n}That is why the forgotten god's return cannot simply be ignored.

I...see.
We will end him.
What can you tell me about the Eldritch Realm?
Ah, to even bear witness to its splendor is a gift from the Three.{^n}{^n}It is another plane of existence, a realm teeming with raw potential and untamed magic. Therein dwell the spawns of magic itself, which sometimes transcend the veil and enter our reality.{^n}{^n}It is where the Witch Gods sit upon their celestial thrones and where they go when they do not grace us with their presence.{^n}{^n}To see it perverted by the machinations of the forgotten god is an insult to everything we stand for.

I see.
Nothing we can't handle.
I'll be careful.

I see.
Victory will be ours.
The Cult of Solael. None sacrifice more to their master than those that serve the Eldritch Flame.{^n}{^n}And none are as rewarded for their loyalty.
Farewell.
Hm, yes, the Great Guardian has foreseen this.{^n}{^n}A bold decision. I hope the maddening whispers of Dreeg's prophecies do not drive you insane as they have so many others.
Um, I'll be careful.
Farewell.
Ah, the Cult of Bysmiel.{^n}{^n}None has displayed greater mastery of binding eldritch beings to their will than the Schemer.{^n}{^n}May her vast web serve you well.
Farewell.
Have you made a decision?
What do I need to do again?
Speak to the masters of the three cults, Draellus, Byscilla and Sagon. Learn their ways and decide whom you shall join and stand beside in the final assault.

Alright.
And which cult do you belong to?
When I first stood before the Witch Gods, I said to them that I shall serve in this life and the next if need be, but I shall only ever serve the Three, not Bysmiel, not Dreeg...not Solael.{^n}{^n}And so I am the herald of the gods. The one who spreads their message and finds worthy allies. All the cults look to my guidance. Even the gods have sought my counsel in the past.

I see.
I'm still thinking.
You are worthy of our ranks, but which of the cults will have your allegiance?
So why did you bring me here?
Ah yes, ever driven by action. I admire your conviction.{^n}{^n}The fated hour is nearly upon us. Soon, we shall strike as one against our formidable foe.{^n}{^n}But we cannot act brashly. Precautions must be taken. Each of the cults is preparing in their own way.{^n}{^n}Speak to the masters of the cults of Bysmiel, Dreeg and Solael. Learn of their methods and align yourself to one cause.{^n}{^n}Draelus, Byscilla and Sagon are already expecting you.
I'll speak with them.
There is something else I must do first.
Why must I choose a cult?
While we may be allies in this endeavor, the cults do not always...see eye to eye on all matters.{^n}{^n}It is best for the sake of peace that you assist only one of the cults. Do not be concerned though, the others will not see you as a foe for your decision. Not here.{^n}{^n}Besides, you may not find all the methods we employ...agreeable. Speak to the cult leaders, learn of their ways, and make your choice.
I'll speak with them.

There is something else I must do first.

I have some questions.
I imagine you do.
Why is this place so important?
The Korvan Basin was once home to a culture deeply rooted in tradition and faith, where an Oath made upon the temple steps was worth more than gold.{^n}{^n}Here was a land of purity by fire, of virtue through zealous faith to a god of unfathomable power. But such blind belief can prove dangerous as the Korvan people learned.{^n}{^n}Tragedy struck as the land was torn asunder by violent eruptions and the people scattered to the winds to escape the fury of their celestial patron.Now this same being, this forgotten deity, stirs once more; and if none stand against it, it may not be just the Korvan Basin that suffers this time around.

I have another question.
I need to go.
Actually, we'll speak later.
Who are your masters?
I am the humble servant of the Witch Gods. By their guiding hand, the secrets of the Eldritch Realm are revealed to me.{^n}{^n}All they ask for in exchange is loyalty and sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Those gathered here have given much of themselves, and they will give much more still if the Three demand it.

I have another question.
Actually, we'll speak later.
So what is this grave threat?
A god long forgotten has re-emerged. It is a malevolent and spiteful creature that has ravaged this land and will do the same to all of Cairn if given the chance.{^n}{^n}You have heard of the dead god Ch'thon, no doubt, and the terrors it spawns even in death. This god, Korvaak, is very much alive, and its followers grow in number and strength each day.{^n}{^n}The awakening of this being is a threat even to the Witch Gods themselves, and so we are here to put a stop to its return before it is too late.

I have another question.
Actually, we'll speak later.
Where are the Witch Gods? Should they not be helping?
The actions of the Three are not for us to comprehend, but I suspect it is by their combined wills that we even stand here now and are not already at the mercy of the forgotten god's vengeance.{^n}{^n}I assure you that while they do not show themselves as they are, they are keenly aware of all that transpires here.

I have another question.
Actually, we'll speak later.
Actually, we'll speak later.
Not right now.
I could hear the battle from here.{^n}{^n}So then, are you ready to open your eyes to powers beyond imagining? To secrets better left uncovered?
So why did you bring me here?

I have some questions first.
I imagine you do.

I have another question.
I need a moment to process all this.
Who are your masters?
I am the humble servant of the Witch Gods. By their guiding hand, the secrets of the Eldritch Realm are revealed to me.{^n}{^n}All they ask for in exchange is loyalty and sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Those gathered here have given much of themselves, and they will give much more still if the Three demand it.

I have another question.
I need a moment to process all this.
That is...disturbing.

Actually, we'll speak later.
I need to think about all this.
I have no doubts you will succeed.{^n}{^n}The Great Eye has decreed it, so it must be so.
Where is the altar again?
Kanatha is at the center of camp.{^n}{^n}Speak to her and endure her trials, or perish and be forgotten. Those are your options.
Alright.
Hm, sure.
You are here, that is good, but hardly evidence that you are prepared for what awaits beyond this plateau.{^n}{^n}You must prove that you are a worthy ally of the Three. Prove that you are indeed the one we seek.
What do I need to do?
Go to the center of the camp, before the statues. Kanatha, Mistress of the Sentinels, awaits you to begin the Eldritch Rites.{^n}{^n}Conquer whatever horrors assault you from the Eldritch Realm and we shall have our answer.
I'll take on your challenge.
Not right now.
May I ask a question?
In time, all your questions will have answers of their own.{^n}{^n}But first, the rites.
I'll take on your challenge.
I want no part in this.
What must I do again?
I'll be back.
I don't have time for your games.
So, you have come, as the Oracle of Dreeg had foreseen.{^n}{^n}But are you truly prepared for what's in store for you in this forsaken land?
What is this place?
You are in the Korvan Basin, a land ravaged by gods and man alike. A land whose secrets are now coveted by a determined few.{^n}{^n}As for this camp...this is the Conclave of the Three. Very much like the Sanctum you've discovered in the marshes outside of Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}Here the three cults set aside their disagreements and join as one against our mutual foes. Foes which threaten your existence as well, I might add.
What do you need me for then?
The Three have decreed that I seek out worthy allies in our battle against a common foe.{^n}{^n}But are you indeed the one we seek? First you must prove yourself.

We'll speak of this later.
I'll be back.

A gathering of occultists, warlocks and witches that serve the Witch Gods.{^n}{^n}Here the three cults set aside their disagreements and join as one against our mutual foes. Foes which threaten your existence as well, I might add.

You stand upon sacred ground.{^n}{^n}Take care where you step.
Farewell.
