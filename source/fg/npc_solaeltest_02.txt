Just leave me alone.
Alright.
So, we've got to pass a test then?{^n}{^n}I'm ready for whatever you've got, so long as it doesn't involve any reading, or magic. I'm not so handy with either of those.{^n}{^n}Let Atrin know when we're going to get started. I trust his lead.
What are you three doing out here?
That's a long story.{^n}{^n}Atrin has a right to be here and I'll make sure of it.
Alright.
Good luck then.
I'll speak with him.
I'm ready for whatever Solael's got in store for us.{^n}{^n}Atrin deserves to be here and I'll make sure of it.
Farewell.
