Altar of Abyd
The altar's power is spent.
Step away from the altar.
The altar awaits the arrival of another.
Step away from the altar.
This altar is teeming with potential, it just requires the correct relic to activate.
Place the Eye of Ekur upon the altar.
Step away from the altar.
Step away from the altar.
The altar lies dormant.
Step away from the altar.
