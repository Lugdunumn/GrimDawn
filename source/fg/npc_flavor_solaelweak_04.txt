Harrold
Just leave me alone.
Alright.
Watch your back.
*Harrold rolls his eyes*{^n}{^n}Oh, I suppose you've come back to tell me that you're going to kill me again.{^n}{^n}That's just great.{^n}{^n}You know what though? I'd rather die than spend another night in this place.
Suck it up.
I can probably make that happen.
I suppose you want me to be happy because I wasn't chosen for the big deal sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Well you know what? I'm still here in this sand-covered butthole of the world. So what's there to be happy about?{^n}{^n}And I still can't get a damn drink.
Yup, I made the wrong choice.
Get over it.
Oh, that's just great, a ritual sacrifice.{^n}{^n}The Great Solael demands blood and of course you come straight to me.{^n}{^n}That would be just the absolutely perfect end to my time in this burning butthole of the world.
They said to choose the weakest.
Oh, yeah, sure, mock me too while you're at it, will ya?{^n}{^n}You know what? I don't care anymore.{^n}{^n}I just want out of this forsaken place. If death is the only way, then so be it.{^n}{^n}Do what you need to.
Alright. (Attack)
You're not even worth a sacrifice.
No, I'm not going to choose you.
Leave me to my business.
What are you working on?
Did you not hear me?{^n}{^n}Let me spell it out for you. Leave, me, alone...{^n}{^n}The less time I spend in this forsaken sand-covered armpit of the world the better, and you serve no purpose but to slow me down.{^n}{^n}Now, leave me alone so I can get my work done and get out of here.
What's wrong?
You're really not listening are you?{^n}{^n}You want to know what's wrong?{^n}{^n}They dragged me out to this forsaken furnace, on a fool's errand, to chase some hopeless maniac through the desert.{^n}{^n}My clothes are soaked with sweat, that is until it all evaporates underneath this slith sun. My skin burns, there's sand in my everything, and there's isn't so much as  a drop of booze as far as the eye can see. To top it off I lie awake,  freezing to death, while all manner of ghastly beasts spend the night screaming and moaning at each other at the edge of camp.{^n}{^n}So you could say I'm a bit upset at my current situation.{^n}{^n}Now, get lost and let me finish my work.
That sounds pretty terrible.
We're officially done talking now.
Fine, fine.
Watch yourself, old man.
Sorry to bother you.
Sorry to bother you.
You got it.
Sorry to bother you.
