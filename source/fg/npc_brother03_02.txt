Anderan
Thanks for the help back there.{^n}{^n}I've gotta be honest, I might be getting used to this whole ghost thing.{^n}{^n}Aaral seems to think it'll be good for business. What with me being able to just...walk into whatever place I feel like.{^n}{^n}Benefits of being a ghost I suppose.{^n}{^n}Anyway, thanks for the help. It's good to be back with my brothers.
Even though you're dead?
Well, I still don't feel very dead. {^n}{^n}I guess that's the funny thing about bein' a ghost. It don't much matter if you're dead or not does it?{^n}{^n}I mean who knows, maybe now I'm invincible or somethin'.{^n}{^n}In any case I'm sure Anorak will have me back to work in no time.
Working on what?
Ok.
I doubt you're invincible.
What business?
Well, Anorak don't like us talkin' about it.{^n}{^n}I suppose he thinks people will come after us if they know.{^n}{^n}But we have a good life here diggin' up old junk from all the tombs and temples around here.{^n}{^n}Especially since this lot showed up. They can't seem to get enough of that stuff.{^n}{^n}That Nika over there at the Bysmiel camp, she's paid us a small fortune to keep mum about the little deal we've got with her so that some artifacts go 'missing' on her behalf.Hm, suppose I've said too much, haven't I?{^n}{^n}Don't go tellin' Anorak we've been talkin' ok?
What's it like being dead?
Ok.
Good luck, being a ghost. 
I'm glad I could help.
Have fun being dead.
*Anderan looks at his ghostly hands*{^n}{^n}Now that I'm a ghost do you think I'll still be able to eat? {^n}{^n}I mean, will I get hungry? Can I even taste things? {^n}{^n}I don' t think I can go on living without some good old grobble stew.{^n}{^n}"Go on living", what am I saying?{^n}{^n}None of this makes any sense.{^n}{^n}Man, this just sucks.
Are you a ghost?
Looks that way don't it?
Certainly does.
Yes...
Ok, good luck being dead.
See you later.
