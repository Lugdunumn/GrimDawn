Homestead
A Final Salute
Find Insignias and return
Scoutmaster Lysell has lost several scouts in the cultist-controlled region to the north of Homestead, in the Blood Grove. Recovering the insignias of lost soldiers is a bit of a ritual, a last rite, for the Black Legion. The Scoutmaster can't afford to send any more men out there, so he has asked you to recover the insignias in his stead.
Collect insignias from fallen Black Legion soldiers in the Blood Grove
Return the Insignias to Scoutmaster Lysell in Homestead
