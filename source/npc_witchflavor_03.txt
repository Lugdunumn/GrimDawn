Andros
Sister Garradia has instructed me to aid you in return for your efforts. {^n}{^n}I have used the heart of Caraxxus to prepare a restorative salve.
Sounds good to me.
This alone should be sufficient payment, but I've been instructed to offer my help if you should need it in the future. {^n}{^n}However, the salve takes some time to prepare. Now leave me, I must return to my work.
Thank you.
I suppose I owe you an apology, inquisitor.{^n}{^n}Thanks to you the circle has been restored and our little refuge is afforded some security once again.
No apology necessary.

And never forget it.
You're welcome.
You are indeed a [[ms]brother[fs]sister] of this coven. {^n}{^n}Thanks to you the circles are restored and our little refuge is afforded some security once again.
Anything to help the coven.

Farewell.
Thanks to you the circles are restored and our refuge is afforded some security once again. 
I did what I could.
It was some spectacle watching you battle those manifestations during the ritual.
Glad you stepped in to help.
When a ritual needs researching or a salve preparing, you can call for Andros.{^n}{^n}When you need something hit with the sharp end of a stick, I suppose we've got you.
Snarky as ever.
You're welcome, Andros.
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. 

I need to be going now.
Excuse me but I must stay focused on my work.
What are you working on? 
The wards that defend this place have been damaged. Matron Malostria demanded that I recover an ancient ritual to aid in repairing them.{^n}{^n}Which, of course, is buried in one of these tomes. 
How were they damaged? 
When the Ugdenbog Fetish was stolen, the circle was broken along with the spell that protects this place.{^n}{^n}We must perform the ritual to restore the circle.

Good luck finding it.
Is there anything I can do to help.
You'll need to speak with Matron Malostria.{^n}{^n}Now I must return to my work.

I'll speak with her.

I'll leave you to your work.
Thank you [[ms]brother[fs]sister] for returning our lost recruits.
I am glad to help.

You're welcome.
Despite my misgivings, you have proven yourself an ally to our coven.{^n}{^n}I suppose I should thank you for returning our lost recruits.
I did what was right.

I suppose you should.
Felt I could help out.
I suppose I should thank you for returning our lost recruits. 
It was the least I could do.
Don't be too please with yourself.{^n}{^n}Garradia has now saddled me with this new recruit. She is certain to slow my work. 
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Ha, with any luck she'll prove to be at least as useful as you have been.
I'll take that as a compliment, I think.
Good, you could use it.
Maybe she'll make you smile for a change.

I suppose you should.
Felt I could help out.
What do you need now? 
How about another restorative salve?
Here you are, now please leave me to my work.
Thanks
I've explained to you, the salve takes time to prepare.{^n}{^n}Now, if you would kindly leave me to my work.
Very well. 
What are you working on?
It is my charge to prepare all materials and rituals used by the coven. As you might imagine this takes a great deal of concentration.{^n}{^n}Now, may I return to my work?

I'll be on my way.
Nothing, I'll be on my way.
Leave me to my work, inquisitor.
What are you working on? 
As if I would explain myself to a Luminari.{^n}{^n}Do not try my patience.
I'll be leaving then.
I'll be on my way. 
Excuse me but I am quite busy.
Are you in charge around here?
Certainly not. You'll should speak to Sister Garradia before somebody mistakes you for a ghoul.{^n}{^n}Now, leave me to my work.

I'll be on my way.
What are you working on?
I'm sorry, is this sharing hour?{^n}{^n}Leave me to my work.

I'll be on my way.
Very well.
