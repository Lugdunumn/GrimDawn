The March to Malmouth
Desperate Measures
The Way North
Inquisitor Creed was unable to determine Ulgrim's location, but he's not ready to give up on his friend just yet. A desperate plea from Devil's Crossing demands his immediate attention and the rising Aetherial threat from the taken city of Malmouth presents a new challenge for the Black Legion.{^n}{^n}However, Creed believes both goals can be equally served by reaching out to the coven of witches hiding out on the edges of Ugdenbog, the only route by land to Malmouth.{^n}{^n}Creed has presented you with his pendant, one of his hidden tricks. With it, you should be able to penetrate the Aetherial flames barring the way north out of the Burrwitch Estates and into Gloomwald, where the coven was known to be hiding.

Destroy the Aetherial Barrier leading north out of the Burrwitch Estates


A Worthy Tribute
With the barrier destroyed, you can now enter Gloomwald and seek out the Coven of Ugdenbog. But the witches are not likely to simply welcome you with open arms, much less help you in your predicament. In order to appease them, Inquisitor Creed recommended hunting down Carraxus Foul, the scourge of Ugdenbog, and bringing its heart to Garradia, one of the witches in the coven.{^n}{^n}Carraxus Foul has been a menace in those parts for years, and its heart is sure to serve some questionable purpose in a witch's ritual. But desperate times demand that such acts be overlooked. Follow the road through Gloomwald and look for a cave near the waterfront. Carraxus Foul had likely turned it into a den.{^n}{^n}Once you have the heart, bring it to the Coven's Refuge, somewhere on the border between Gloomwald and Ugdenbog. Present it to the witches along with Ulgrim's Keepsake.
Slay Carraxus Foul and take its heart.
