My Alice, I must go to Malmouth to find her.
Be careful out there.
Who are you? Nobody but Aldritch comes down here anymore. Unless...
Calm down, I've dealt with that monster.
As much as it relieves me to hear that, I will not know peace until I find my baby, Alice.
He took your baby?
Yes, he sent her away, on the boats to Malmouth. I begged him to leave her with me.{^n}{^n}How could he just send her away like that? His own flesh and blood? I can't bear to think of my beautiful little girl, out there all alone with those monsters.
Come with me, I can lead you to safety.
No, I can't. I just can't leave my precious Alice.{^n}{^n}I have to go find her. 
You won't make it out there alone. 
I've seen such horrors down here, locked up like an animal. Every night he came to me to play his little games.{^n}{^n}I can't leave my Alice to such a fate, or worse. I have to find her. 
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure. You rid me of that monster and I thank you, but I must go and find Alice.{^n}{^n}She's my baby. I am all that she has. 
I understand. Be careful out there. 
Very well. Be careful out there.
Wait, Van Aldritch was the father? That monster?
Yes, but that was before all of this madness. He swore to make an honest woman of me, but he was greedy and selfish even before he started to change.{^n}{^n}When my precious Alice came, he swore the baby wasn't his and shunned us.
How did you end up down here?
When things started to change he came to me and promised to protect us, but it was all a sick game.{^n}{^n}He took Alice from me and locked me up down here as his little play thing.


How horrid, but at least you're free now.
Van Aldritch lies dead. Are you alright?
No, far from it.{^n}{^n}The horrors I've endured here at the mercy of Van Aldritch will haunt me to my dying days; but I must endure for my baby, Alice.
Your baby?
I'll be right back.
