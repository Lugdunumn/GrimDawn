The Liberation of Malmouth
Tip of the Spear
Failed Assault
According to resistance intel, the main Aetherial force has walled themselves off in the Crown Hill district. The only way to access it is over the causeway through its massive front gates. Before the fall of their base, the resistance made a failed attempt to demolish the gates with an improvised explosive. Inquisitor Creed wants you to lead a renewed assault on Crown Hill. Recover the Resistance Bomb and use it to destroy the gate. Creed has also given you an additive that he claims will make the explosive more potent.

With the gates to Crown Hill destroyed, the resistance fighters and the Black Legion can now begin their final assault. Claim the riftgate on the far side of the gates so more troops can be moved to Crown Hill.
