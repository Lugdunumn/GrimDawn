The March to Malmouth
Into the Jaws of Madness
A Place of Power
Garradia of the Coven of Ugdenbog has kept her end of the bargain. She marked Ulgrim's Keepsake with a ritual binding and informed you of an ancient altar once used by the coven during its darker years. It has fallen into disuse and the site has since been reclaimed by the swamp, but the veil is weakened there and should serve as a conduit for what you seek.{^n}{^n}Bring Ulgrim's Keepsake to the Altar of Rattosh, located in Ugdenbog to the north of Barrowholm, and perform Garradia's ritual.

The warrior was pulled in to the darkness from which the Loghorrean itself was spawned and so you must now travel deep into the void, deeper than anyone had ever dared before.{^n}{^n}Enter the portal at the Altar of Rattosh and traverse the Desolate Wastes to find the portal to the Void's Edge.
