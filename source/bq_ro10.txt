Bounty: The Lost Oligarch
Bounty
We have always believed there to be three Oligarchs from the ancient Arkovia, but recent sightings in the Undercity have proven our texts wrong. Oligeane Dar appears to be a fourth Oligarch that has recently been reunited with the rest of the Arkovian leaders.{^n}{^n}Three Oligarchs is threat enough, we cannot allow a fourth to roam freely. She must be banished back to whatever hell she crawled from.{^n}{^n}We have set aside some of our scavenged materials as reward for this task.



Slay Oligeane Dar

Turn In
You have completed the task for the Rovers and should return to the Bounty Table for your reward.
