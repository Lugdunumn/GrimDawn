Bounty: The Ascended
Bounty
A Reanimator walks the halls of the Warden's Laboratory with an uncanny connection to the Aether.{^n}{^n}While most Reanimators can merely conjure bursts of Aetherfire, this one can tear gaps in reality itself, calling down manifestations of the Aether unlike that of the most powerful arcanists.{^n}{^n}The Order wishes to study this anomaly. Travel to Burrwitch and slay this Barrostrandt, the Ascended so that we may investigate its remains.{^n}{^n}Your efforts will be compensated with materials from our stores.
