Oliver Thornsbury
I heard from Douglass that my farm has been cleared of the infestation. Don't suppose I have you to thank for that?
I found your wife's diary. It has some interesting stories in there.

Good luck out there.
I hope it's a good harvest.
Blasted Dermapterans. An entire year's worth of food is gonna go to waste out there.
Why hasn't the Black Legion cleared them out?
Hell if I know. Somer's only concerned with her war against the Aetherials. Then there's that blasted cult.{^n}{^n}I'm no soldier, so I suppose I'll just keep my mouth shut and work the fields we do have.
I see.
I found your wife's diary. It has some interesting stories in there.
Oh, not again. Does she fly in this one? Her head is up in the clouds when we need it back down here.{^n}{^n}*Oliver sighs*{^n}{^n}Then again, we could all use a distraction these days. Maybe it will help her deal with all this tragedy.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
