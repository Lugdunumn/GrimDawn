The Outlaw Threat
Murderers and Worse
Speak to Mornay
With the Warden threat dealt with, Captain Bourbon feels it is imperative to reopen the way northwest towards the once thriving farming community that supplied this region. That does not come without its own problems though. Bandits, former convicts from the prison, are rampant in that region and could pose a serious threat to Devil's Crossing. Mornay has just returned from Old Arkovia and should be able to provide information on their activities and whereabouts.

Repair the bridge (skippable)
Before you can venture out to the Arkovian Foothills to the northwest, the bridge must first be repaired. In order to repair the bridge, you must provide the necessary materials at its construction site.

Kill Edmund
With the bridge repaired, you need to enter the Arkovian Foothills and let the outlaws know that Devil's Crossing is not a prize for the taking.

Report to Mornay
It is as Mornay feared. The outlaws are mobilizing against Devil's Crossing and it is only a matter of time before they attack. Report back to Mornay in Devil's Crossing to determine your next steps.
