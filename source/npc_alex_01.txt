Rook was one of the fun adults. He would play with us and let me pull on his moustache.{^n}{^n}When is he coming back? Mrs. Constance says he went away on a journey.
He'll, um, be a while.
I'm sure he'll be back any day.

Mrs. Constance says you've brought us real food. Thank you!
You're welcome. Now eat up!
Did you really make the Warden go away? He was so scary!
That I did.
Wow! You're really brave.
I just do what needs to be done.
Thank you.
Run along now.
Mrs. Constance is making new clothes for everyone!
Glad to hear it.
Mrs. Constance says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
Why is that?
Cause you have evil in your tummy.
I see.
Alright then.
