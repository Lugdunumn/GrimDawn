Praetorian Zedlee
As you were.
Got any stories from the frontlines?

I was there when the capital fell...{^n}{^n}Possessed men turning on us, corrupted mutants pouring through the gates...it was a living nightmare.{^n}{^n}I watched half my squad get torn to shreds in the first exchange by enemies we had never faced before. It was hopeless. Surprised no one when the commander called for a full retreat.
Had a nasty run-in with a Chthonic fiend on the way south. {^n}{^n}Those things have claws that will cleave right through steel. I'd know...got a few scars to prove it and a shield that's now in the scrap pile.
I hope you never have to meet the Cult of Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}They are depraved lunatics, traitors to humanity who worship the very beings that threaten to destroy us all.{^n}{^n}If you've ever wondered if evil truly exists within the hearts of men, then look no further than the Bloodsworn.
If you have to go back out there, steer clear of the Reanimators. They are the gangly skeletal creatures with aether crystals embedded in their backs.{^n}{^n}They spread misery with their very existence. Their touch ignites the earth with aetherfire. But most despicable of all is their ability to raise the dead to do their bidding.{^n}{^n}It is one thing to watch your comrade die in battle. It is entirely another to then have to put him back in the dirt because he has become an undead puppet. I don't wish such a thing upon anyone.
Farewell.
Farewell.
Stay on your guard. The enemies of humanity are all around us.
Can you open the gates?
I'm sorry. We are under strict orders to not open the gates until Ulgrim has reported in.
I see.

I'll be careful.
