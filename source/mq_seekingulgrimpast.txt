The March to Malmouth
A Witch's Bargain
Find The Bog Village
Garradia of the Coven of Ugdenbog has accepted your offering and agreed to help you in finding a way through the Aetherfire. In a way, finding Ulgrim may be just the key to reaching Malmouth...through the Chthonic void.{^n}{^n}But before she helps you, there is one more thing you must do for her: retrieve the Ugdenbog Fetish from the denizens of a nearby village called Barrowholm. Head out east from the Coven's Refuge and make your way through the bog, headed north, until you've see buildings.
Find Barrowholm

Speak to Scorv
You have found the village that Garradia has instructed you to seek out.{^n}{^n}The man named Scorv Egdenor seems to be in charge. Speak to him in Barrowholm about the Ugdenbog Fetish.
