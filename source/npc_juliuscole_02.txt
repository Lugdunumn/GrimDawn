I can't thank you enough. You spared us from a life of petty crime and extortion. I promise you: that's all behind us now.
What happened to you and Helen?
Nothing I'm proud of. Before the Grim Dawn, I was just a homeless pickpocket, scrounging by with the few coins I stole from those more fortunate. Course, that all changed when the world went down the slith hole. I...killed a man over some bread and supplies. Fled what was left of Burrwitch that same night. I met Helen out in Wightmire. She was being harrassed by some grobles. There weren't many of them, so I got bold. Ended up spooking them off by igniting some swamp gas. Helen and I stuck together since. We started this hoax about a month back when we realized there was no way we were going to sustain ourselves just wandering the wilderness. We tricked some travelers with our little scheme and traded what we stole with others. Sure, it came down to guns sometimes, but it beat dealing with the bandits.{^n}{^n}I gotta tell ya though, I'm glad we came to an understanding back in the Arkovian Foothills. I don't think we'd stand a chance against you.
Just do your share around here and you will always have a home.
Just behave yourself.
