Stealing from Thieves
Collect supplies
The survivors at the Corrigan Mine require supplies if they are going to survive. The trolls of the Misty Vale have been mercilessly preying on the humans, taking whatever supplies scavenged supplies back to their camps. It is time for some regular old retribution. Strike back at the thieving trolls and steal back what was never theirs to begin with. Bring any supplies you recover to Stanley Larsen, the quartermaster of Corrigan Mine.
