Markon
Back off!{^n}{^n}You don't have any business being here.
Relax, old man.
I said, get away from me.{^n}{^n}I know what you've done. We don't want any more trouble from you.
Ok, I'm leaving.
Watch your back.
I'm just passing through.
Ah, now you know, now you have seen with your own eyes. Is he not magnificient?
Ravager?
Yes of course, Ravager.{^n}{^n}Who else might I be speaking of. {^n}{^n}You were there, I saw you. Scorv chose you to finalize the ritual. {^n}{^n}You spoke with the spirit. It must have been life changing.

No, not really.
You were spying on the ritual?
I uh... well  yes.{^n}{^n}You caught me, you caught me red handed.{^n}{^n}How could I pass up such an opportunity?{^n}{^n}I'd have given my life for a chance to cast my gaze upon his magnificence.

Hey may yet take it. 
Meh, I wasn't impressed.
What? How dare you?{^n}{^n}I should hope he isn't listening right now. {^n}{^n}Great spirit... Ravager, I'm sure [[ms]he[fs]she] didn't mean it. I ask as your humble servant, please fogive this poor imbecile. 
You just might be crazy.
Still not impressed.
I don't have time, sorry old man.
The shaman returns. I knew you would bring great things to our little village.{^n}{^n}I feel that we are driven by the same things, you and I.
And what's that?
Hunger, my friend. The hunger that speaks to you, that calls to you in your sleep, that aches when you wake, that itches you when you find yourself lost and alone.{^n}{^n}The spirit watches you, it watches all who enter this place.{^n}{^n}Its power is real my friend. Listen when it speaks to you, give in to your hunger.
Uh, ok. I need to go now.
Thanks for the advice old man.
I doubt it.
I'm busy, I need to go.
Welcome back. It seems Scorv was right to trust you. {^n}{^n}I sense the Great Spirit is very pleased by what you've done here.
The spirit?
Yes, the spirit that inhabits this place.{^n}{^n}The Wendigo, my friend. Have you paid no attention during your time here?{^n}{^n}It watches us, even now, feeding on our desires, on our hunger. It is truly glorious.
You're insane.
No my friend, I am one with it. Listen... it calls to you. Do you not feel it? {^n}{^n}The hunger drives us all. You must embrace it. You must feed on the flesh.
Ok. I'm going to leave now. 
Nope, I don't think so.
I feel it.
Ah, yes, of course.
Ok. I'm going to leave now. 
I need to get going.
A shaman, no doubt an insatiable hunger has driven you to this place.


What hunger?
Oh, you seem confused.{^n}{^n}I meant the hunger for discovery, of course. You must be wondering about our wonderful village.
Yes, tell me about Barrowholm.
I must get going.
I must get going.
Ah, the newcomer. A fresh face is always welcome in Barrowholm.{^n}{^n}But what desire is it that brings you all the way out here?
I have business with whoever is in charge.
You'll be looking for Scorv Egdenor then.{^n}{^n}He should be somewhere about town. I'm sure he'll be interested to meet you. We don't get visitors out here very often.

Thanks. I'll go find him.
What can you tell me about Barrowholm?
As much as any, I suspect. I've been here my entire life.{^n}{^n}This place is my home, always has been. I couldn't leave it if I wanted to.{^n}{^n}But there isn't much of interest that happens out in the bog, if you can believe it.{^n}{^n}Things got exciting briefly when Scorv Egdenor showed up some years back. Since then things have been good for our little town.
Scorv just showed up?
I couldn't tell you how long it's been but some time ago Scorv arrived here from beyond the bog.{^n}{^n}It was a desperate time for us, too many mouths to feed and too little food to go around.{^n}{^n}Scorv was a charmer. Everyone took to him right away; and who could blame us? He was a problem-solver. He generously stayed in Barrowholm and showed us what to do to survive. He promised us a better life. Better yet, he delivered upon that promise.
Where can I find the person in charge?
Thanks for the help. 
That's interesting. I have to go.
Sorry, I need to be going.
