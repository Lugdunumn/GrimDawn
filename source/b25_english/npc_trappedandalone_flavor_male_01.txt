Your news was difficult to bear, but I must thank you.
I did what I had to.
How goes the journey, traveler?
A Chthonian almost tricked me into releasing it here.
You must be speaking of Kalista.{^n}{^n}She is my daughter, or at least was before something horrid possessed her.{^n}{^n}Even as an infant, she would speak in tongues we could not decipher, her eyes a vibrant red. When dark omens began appearing, I knew I had to do something, but I could not bring myself to kill my child.{^n}{^n}We abandoned her within a tomb and sealed the entrance. May the gods have mercy on us.
I have banished the Chthonian for good.
I...that is a relief.{^n}{^n}Thank you for releasing my daughter from this hell.
Farewell.
What omens?
Blood would fill her crib, more than if you bled a man dry.{^n}{^n}And fires...fires would appear as if out of thin air.{^n}{^n}When we spoke her name, she would shake her head and say: "No, I am Ballog'Nath."
I have banished the Chthonian for good.

That is horrible.

I have ended the Chthonian's life.
I will slay this Chthonian.
That is horrible.
The creature may be a Chthonian, but I had to look upon it wearing my daughter's skin.{^n}{^n}Imagine for a moment that you were considering ending the life of your own child. It's a mind shattering thought.
No matter. You should have ended this.
I'm sorry, it must have been difficult.
A horrible fate, but I have ended its life.
I will slay this Chthonian.
It's a dangerous world.
Sadly, that it is. Normally we would have moved on by now, but it's not safe to travel anymore.{^n}{^n}At least the land provides for our needs.
Farewell.
Just passing through.
