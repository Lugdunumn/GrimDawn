Eraline
Did you talk to the other kids for me?
You're right, they are monsters.
So you did talk to them.{^n}{^n}Did you say something mean? Did you scare them? 
I don't think they'll be bothering you for a while. 
Oh, thank you so much [[ms]mr[fs]ma'am].
Don't worry about it. 
I told you we're all in this together.
I told them you're a necromancer. 
You did what?{^n}{^n}Oh no, what am I gonna do now?
Don't worry they'll never know.
But I can't do any necromancer spells.
It'll be our little secret.
Keep practicing.
I'll be back.
Whoah, hey!{^n}{^n}Are you one of those necromancers?
That's none of your business, kid.
You're really mean... That's so great!{^n}{^n}I mean it makes sense, you're a necromancer and all.{^n}{^n}You probably spend a lot of time with dead things. Well, I mean undead things.
I certainly do.
Oh man, that must be so much fun,{^n}{^n}I'm gonna be a necromancer some day too. Then I can bring dead stuff back to life.{^n} {^n}Like rats, and those nastly little grobble things, and like a huge slimy monster made of horse bones.{^n} {^n}You can do that right?
Look, I don't have time for this.
I am, but let's keep that between you and I.
Oh, ok. Like our little secret, I get it.{^n}{^n}People probably think youâ€™re really scary. I won't tell anybody.{^n}{^n}I'm gonna be a necromancer some day too. Then I can bring dead stuff back to life.{^n}{^n}Like rats, and those nasty little grobble things, and like a huge slimy monster made of horse bones.{^n}{^n}You can do that, right?
Uh, not exactly.
Oh, come on. I know you can do it.{^n}{^n}You can probably make all kinds of nasty stuff.

Yeah...Sure.
I knew it.{^n}{^n}Oh man, I can't wait.{^n}{^n}I'm gonna bring back all kinds of stuff.
Shouldn't you be with your parents or something?
*Eraline hesitates*{^n}{^n}They're all dead, ok?{^n}{^n}My brothers my sisters, mommy and daddy.{^n}{^n}The monsters came and took mommy first, then daddy went looking for her and never came back.
Is that why you want to be a Necromancer?
Um...Maybe...{^n}{^n}I just wanna see mommy again.{^n}{^n}I can't stand it down here. It stinks and all the other kids are mean. They just make fun of me all the time. I'm...I'm all by myself.{^n}{^n}I just thought if I was a necromancer maybe I could bring them back and I wouldn't be lonely anymore.
I'm sorry kid, that's just not how it works.
You're probably right.{^n}{^n}I just...I don't want to be alone anymore.
What's wrong with the other kids?
You're not alone, kid. We're all in this together.
I'll avenge your family.
I'm sorry about your family, kid.
What happend to your brothers and sisters?
*Eraline shakes her head*{^n}{^n}I don't want to talk about it ok?

I'm sorry about your family, kid.
Keep practicing, kid.
I'm afraid not.
I don't have time to talk.
Did you come over here to make me go back and play with the other kids?
No. What's wrong with the other kids?
They're evil. They just keep making fun of me because my parents are dead.{^n}{^n}Thad says my mommy is a monster now and she's gonna come get me when I sleep.
That's pretty terrible, but you're safe down here.
What do you mean, is mommy really a monster?{^n}{^n}Is she really coming to get me?
No. The other kids are lying to you.
You really think so?{^n}{^n}It doesn't matter anyway. They're never going to stop making fun of me.
I'll talk to them.
You would do that?
Sure kid.
No one likes a bully.
No, probably not.
Yeah, probably not.
Yeah, probably.
Nope.
