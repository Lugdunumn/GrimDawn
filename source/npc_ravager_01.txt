Ravager
What a delightful creature!{^n}{^n}Even I did not suspect what you were capable of.
How are you still alive?
You cannot end me any more than you could stop the skies or still the seas.{^n}{^n}I am Ravager, I am eternal.
We'll see about that! (Attack)
Sounds like a challenge.
And never forget it.
Don't underestimate me again.
A feisty little mortal. Your rage amuses me.{^n}{^n}Have you come to be torn to shreds? Or have you learned your place?

I'm just getting started! (Misguidedly Attack)
I'll be going
What is this little thing that stands before me?

Um, I'll be going.
What is this little thing that stands before me?{^n}{^n}Have you come to offer yourself to a god, shaman? Or perhaps you've already tasted of my gift and have come to thank me?

Your powers are invaluable in combat.
As they should be, little shaman.{^n}{^n}Drink deep of my power and bring yourself closer to your god.

I will.
Farewell.
I am wary of your gifts.
I'd rather not discuss this.
What is this little thing that stands before me?{^n}{^n}Have you come to offer yourself to a god?
May I ask some questions?
I will indulge your curiosities.
What are you?
I am the hunger, the giver and the taker.{^n}{^n}But none who receive my gift hunger ever again.{^n}{^n}You stand before a primal force of nature, made manifest.

You do not impress me, I've faced a god and won.

I have another question.
I...see.
Can I receive your gift?
You wish to be remade in my image? To offer your soul to the wendigo?{^n}{^n}An amusing request, but one I shall not grant you.{^n}{^n}You entertain me, human, but you reek of Aetherial corruption. It is only by the mercy of all you have done for my servants that I not tear you apart where you stand.
I have another question.
I am corrupted by the Aetherials?
The primordial servant may have left your body, but it has also left its mark.{^n}{^n}You are tainted, broken. Not even worthy of standing before me.{^n}{^n}When this world is scoured of the dead gods and their pathetic servants, the likes of you shall be next.


I have another question.
I see.
Um, I think I'll be going.
I won't just stand here and take insults from you.
Is that so? Does the worm wish to rise above the dirt and fly as a bird?{^n}{^n}Wishes do not change our station. Learn your place and appreciate that you still live.

I have another question.
I'd rather not. (Misguidedly Attack)
I'll leave you be, this time...
I've defeated mightier than you for less.
You speak of Mogdrogen? That pathetic creature has been in decline for centuries.{^n}{^n}He and I shall meet again, and this time he shall not have the upper hand.{^n}{^n}As for you, do not mock me with your empty threats, worm.
I have another question.

How's this for an empty threat? (Misguidedly Attack)
I'll leave you be, this time...
I see.
What is your will?
I shall begin by hunting down the one who scorned me. The beast god will suffer for his transgressions.{^n}{^n}Then we shall scour this world clean of dead gods and their pathetic servants.
What has Mogdrogen done?
At the peak of his power, the beast god strove to rule over nature as he saw fit.{^n}{^n}Others like myself rose to oppose him, many fell. My body was destroyed and my disembodied form forced to roam the veil for millennia.{^n}{^n}But I have returned, and my vengeance will be absolute.
I have another question.
Send that arrogant bastard my regards.
I see.
I have another question.
Praise Ravager!
I'll be going now.
Did you see the Grim Dawn coming?
If I told you that I sensed the great unrest stirring just beyond the veil for some time, will that make you feel better about all that has transpired?{^n}{^n}Humans amuse me, and some are even useful, but I see no purpose in altering your fate; except perhaps to deny my enemies your lives as a resource, but that can just as easily be achieved with your deaths.
I have another question.
That's not what I was hoping to hear.
That's...troubling.
You do not impress me, I've faced a god and won.
You speak of Mogdrogen? That pathetic creature has been in decline for centuries.{^n}{^n}He and I shall meet again, and this time he shall not have the upper hand.
I have another question.
 (Misguidedly Attack)
I see.
Why the hatred of Chthonians?
They seek to claim blood that is rightfully mine!{^n}{^n}I shall feast upon the marrow of their bones and the blood they had gathered will briefly sate my endless hunger!
I have another question.
I see.
Nevermind.
Praise Ravager!
I'll be going now.
I kneel before no one.
What is this little thing that stands before me?
What are you?
I am the hunger, the giver and the taker.{^n}{^n}But none who receive my gift hunger ever again.{^n}{^n}You have not yet come to understand, but you will.
I...see.
Um, I'll be going.
