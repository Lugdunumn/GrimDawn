Order of Death's Vigil
Seals of Binding
Collect Seals
The ritual involved in bringing back Malkadarr is a complicated and unstable one. The cultists in the Blood Grove use Seals of Binding to stabilize their rituals. Gather some of these Seals for Master Varuuk at Sorrow's Bastion so that the Order can use them to bring back Malkadarr's souls from beyond the veil of death.
