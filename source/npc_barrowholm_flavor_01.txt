Terise
You have no business here stranger.{^n}{^n}Leave this place before I cook you into one of my stews.
Ok, I'll be leaving then.
That's quite rude.
The Great Spirit is very pleased with you stranger.{^n}{^n}All you have done for us will certainly not be forgotten.
I'd rather just forget any of this ever happened.
I do what I can to help.
Ah, you're back. It's great to see you again.{^n}{^n}I must thank you.
Thank me for what?
Well, thanks to you we have fresh meat once again. It's been some time since I cooked with such wonderfully fresh cuts.{^n}{^n}Though Aurin always seems to get the best parts before the rest of us can get our hands on them. I think old Scorv favors her.{^n}{^n}No harm done, I'm quite happy with fresh meat whenever I can get it.
How did I help?
I heard it was you who went out and checked the camps. Is that not true?
Um, It was me.
Well then, thank you. I'm sure the Great Spirit is quite pleased with you.
I certainly hope so.
I'll be going now.
No, I think you're mistaken.
I'm glad I could help.
I'm sorry, I need to go.
Welcome back. I've just finished making a fesh batch of stew.{^n}{^n}Are you sure I can't interest you in trying some?
No I'm all set.
Suit your self.{^n}{^n}This batch is made with fresh meat, thanks to you.
Fesh meat?
Indeed, it seems our traps were full this time around. I heard it was you who went out to check them.{^n}{^n}Those poor creatures were horrified when you sent them back here. They had no idea what they were in for.{^n}{^n}All the better. The fear lingers in the meat leaving a truly unique flavor. It's delectable really.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Enjoy your stew, I'm glad I could help.
Sure, I think I'll try some this time.
I knew you had it in you. I could sense it.{^n}{^n}Here you are, a freshly prepared batch.
This is delicious.
It ought to be. It was made with fresh meat, thanks to you.
Thanks to me?
Indeed, those poor souls you sent back here from the traps. They had no idea what was in store for them.{^n}{^n}You should have seen the terror in their eyes. It was perfect.{^n}{^n}Fear makes the meat taste better you know.
I think I'm going to be sick.
I'll be going now. Thanks for the stew.
Thank you.
No thank you, I need to go.
I love a [[ms]man[fs]woman] with a solid appetite.
Any chance I could get more of that stew?
Oh, I'm sorry.{^n}{^n}I'm afraid we're all out for now. Perhaps another time when we've acquired some fresh meat.
Alright.
I think I'll be on my way.
Are you quite sure you're not hungry?
On second thought, a bowl of stew sounds good.
I knew you had it in you. I could sense it.{^n}{^n}Here you are, a freshly prepared batch.

Thanks, I'll be going now.
I'm alright, thanks.
Well hello there, stranger. Welcome to our humble village.{^n}{^n}You look famished. Might I offer you a bowl of stew? I made it myself right from one of Aurin's best recipes.{^n}{^n}Sure to put some meat back on those bones of yours.
A bowl of stew sounds good.
Excellent. I thought you might enjoy it.{^n}{^n}You have a ravenous look about you.
It was a little gamey.
Ah well, we haven't had much fresh meat around here recently.{^n}{^n}Though it seems that may be about to change.
Well, thank you anyway.
I'll be going now.
Thanks, I'll be going now.
No, I don't think so. 
Well then, I must say I'm quite disappointed.{^n}{^n}I thought I sensed a hunger in you. But I was clearly mistaken.
No harm done.
I need to go now.
There's no way I'm eating your stew.
I think I'll be on my way.
