Strange Disappearances
Missing supplies
Supplies and men have been going missing from the Corrigan Mine, with no indication of break-in or tampering. Men assigned to patrol near AREA never return. That would be the best place to start investigating the strange disappearances.
Track down the missing supplies

Report back
You tracked the missing supplies and persons to a cave in the region. There you discovered tell-tale signs of Aetherial activity as bodies of the recently deceased were loaded onto carts for transport. As if to confirm your fears, an Aetherial revealed itself to you and demanded that you cease meddling in their affairs. It is evident that there are others like him at the Corrigan Mine. Samantha must be warned.
