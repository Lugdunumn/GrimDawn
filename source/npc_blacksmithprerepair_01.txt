Kaylon
My shop is a bloody disaster!{^n}{^n}These forsaken monstrosities have no respect for an honest day's work. Do me a favor and smash a few mutant skulls in for old Kaylon.
I'll be sure to.
Just fix it up.
These heathenous fiends have no respect for a hard working man.
Who's that?
Those damned things up in the city. {^n}{^n}First they tore my shop, I had to work out of a tent. Then they came and tore up my tent, dented and bent all my damn tools,  even put out my fire.{^n}{^n}That thing's been burning for 20 years.{^n}{^n}Now I'm left to hide in the sewer with not a single tool to my name. {^n}{^n}What am I supposed to do?
I'm sure the resistance could use some help.
Look now, when it comes down to it I'll do whatever it takes to help out.{^n}{^n}But without a good tool and a hot flame there really ain't much I can do.{^n}{^n}That's what happens when you spend 30 years learning how to pound iron.{^n}{^n}Once I get a fire going, then I'll be able to help.
We'll find you a place to work.{^n}
Sounds good.
Stop complaining?
I have no idea.
Sorry, I don't have time to chat.
