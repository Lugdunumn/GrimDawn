It's a good thing you showed up when you did. {^n}{^n}I don't think we would have stayed hidden much longer. We could hear those things patrolling all around us.
What were you doing out there?
We were merchants and purveyors of goods before the city was overrun.{^n}{^n}Hyram thought it would be a good idea for us to return to our shops in search of supplies.{^n}{^n}So he volunteered us to help the resistance. I'll admit it made sense, but we had no idea what that poor idiot had signed us up for.{^n}{^n}I don't think he did either. People like us have no business out there fighting.
Well, you're safe now. 
Thanks to you. {^n}{^n}Listen, now that the resistance is rebuilding this base I'm going to set up shop again.{^n}{^n}As poorly as things went before, I think Hyram is right. People like us need to stand up and fight. We'll just do it from back behind the walls.{^n}{^n}I should be ready soon. Come see me if you need anything.
I will. Thanks.
Stay safe.
It looks like the guards have this places locked down now.{^n}{^n}You certainly won't find me outside these walls any time soon.
That's good.
It's best you stay here.
