Kalive
I knew you were going to be trouble when I first laid eyes on you.{^n}{^n}You best watch your back around here.
Keep your threats to yourself.
Don't forget what happened last time.
Thanks for the warning.
I don't know what Scorv sees in you.{^n}{^n}He may have chosen you to finalize the ritual but I'm still not impressed. {^n}{^n}I'll still have my eye on you.
I hope you do.
Have fun with that.
Whatever, chump.
Seems I may have misjudged you.{^n}{^n}Don't expect me to apologize.
You've had a change of heart.
Well, I heard you've been helping out around here. {^n}{^n}My belly is full thanks to you and I appreciate it.
I do what I can to help.
Suit yourself.
Look, we don't want any troublemakers around here.
Or maybe you don't want anyone to know what's going on out here.
I don't know what you're implying but whatever it is, I don't like it.
I don't know either but I intend to find out.
That's too bad.
See you later.
I have no intention of causing any trouble.
Maybe, but I'll still be keeping an eye on you.
You do that.
If I decide to cause trouble, you'll be the first to know.
I'm just passing through.
