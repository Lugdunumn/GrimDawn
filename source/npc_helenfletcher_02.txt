Thank you for taking mercy on us. This place...it's amazing.
What happened to you and Julius?
I was a companion in Burrwitch, down at the Lusty Mare near the docks. Don't give me that look, it was a respected establishment. Frankly, working there saved my life. You can always count on a few eager men to defend a helpless gal. No idea if any of them survived the attack, I wasn't about to check. I put Burrwitch behind me as fast as I could. Course that was a dumb move. Not a mile out of Burrwitch, I got myself cornered by a band of grobles. It was Julius who saved me that time. To be honest, I took advantage of that man. Put myself before him that night and clung onto him since for survival. But he's been good to me, and I want to do right by him.{^n}{^n}The little roadside scheme was my idea. Swindling a few honest souls so that we could survive was nothing I was proud of, but the alternative was going to the bandits. Julius is no hardened criminal, and I don't want to imagine what they do to women. Our chance meeting with you was the best thing that's happened to us in months. Thank you again.
You can earn an honest living here. Just do your share.
Stay out of trouble.
