If it wasn't for Sahdina I'd...{^n}{^n}Let's not talk about that. Is there something you need?
Let's have a bowl of soup.
Farewell.
If it wasn't for Sahdina I'd...{^n}{^n}Let's not talk about that. Is there something you need?
Let's have a bowl of soup.
Farewell.
By the gods, you've done it.{^n}{^n}I was about ready to start boiling boots.
So high-class meals from here on out?
*Edwin laughs*{^n}{^n}I wish!
Let's have a bowl of soup.
Farewell.
Let's have a bowl of soup.
Glad that's resolved.
I...um, Ulgrim just packed up and left. Said that he saw what he needed to here and that it was time to move on.{^n}{^n}Not sure what he meant by it, but he had some mean looking blades packed away with his cooking supplies. Do you think he's a threat?
Where do you think he went?
I haven't a clue. He seemed to be in an awful hurry.
I see. Thanks for the info.
Not sure yet. Thanks for the info.
Ulgrim taught me a thing or two before he left. Now, I ain't some master chef or nothin', but hopefully it'll be better than the grub I've been serving up before.{^n}{^n}At least as long as we have rations to go around...
I've seen him in Homestead. He's no cook.
Oh? He did seem to have some mean looking blades packed away with his cooking supplies. Do you think he's a threat?
He seems to want to help humanity.
Well that's a relief. Enough bad folks out there as it is.{^n}{^n}Good to know there's at least one guy out there fighting the good fight.
Now about that bowl of soup...
Indeed.
We will see. He's a dangerous assassin.
What a stinking slith. I should check to see if he snuck any poisons in the seasonings.{^n}{^n}The soup he made is damn fine though.
I'll try a bowl.
Just be careful.
Where do you think he went?
I haven't a clue. He seemed to be in an awful hurry.
Farewell.
Oh yeah? Let's have a bowl.
Here you go.
Wow, that was actually not terrible. Thanks.
Sorry, Captain says we're on rations. You've already had a bowl today.
Fine, fine.
Good to hear.
Where'd you find this guy? He'd make a soup out of stone if you asked him to, and I reckon it would still taste damn fine!
Rock soup, eh? Is it better than what you've been serving?
We got a joker in the midst now, eh?
I gotta go.
Sounds delicious.
I ain't gonna pretend that what I make is good, or even edible, but it fills up the gut and keeps us going. Can't do much without some proper equipment and supplies. If you ever want a bowl of the Edwin Special, you just let me know.
I'll, um, keep that in mind.
You must be the Taken the rumors been spreading about. Now I ain't gonna judge as I heard you've done right by us with that undead mess up in Lower Crossing. The name's Edwin and I do the cooking around here.
Pleased to meet you.
