Jagged Waste
Manticore Venom
Manticore Venom
Deathmark Kadris of the Black Legion has been tasked with hunting down dangerous wildlife roaming the areas outside of Homestead. During his deployment, he has discovered that the venom that the manticores produce in their barbed tails is particularly potent and could perhaps serve the Legion well in their fight against the Chthonians. If you bring him a poison gland from a Manticore Wastestalker, then he will reward you with a blade marked with the beast's venom. Manticores can be found abundantly in the Jagged Waste, southwest of Kadris' camp.
Collect a Manticore Poison Gland from Manticore Wastestalkers in the Jagged Waste
Return the venom to Deathmark Kadris at his camp in the Pine Barrens
