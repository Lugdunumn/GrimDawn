The Feast
Return to Scorv Egdenor
Ravager will soon be here and it will hunger for the hearts of the living. But not just any hearts will do for the spirit's first meal.{^n}{^n}You have been instructed by Scorv to set out into Ugdenbog and Gloomwald and slay three Wendigo Ancients known as Handarroth, Ollivioth and Yuvoloth. These creatures have long ago outlived their purpose and must now perform one final duty for Ravager: act as a catalyst for his glorious entry into Cairn. The Great Wendigo Spirit has called to them and drawn them out of hiding so that you can perform the necessary rites.{^n}{^n}Once you have collected the hearts of the three ancients, bring them to Scorv Egdenor at Barrowholm.


Collect Handarroth's Heart
Collect Ollivioth's Heart
Collect Yuvoloth's Heart
Bring the Hearts to Scorv Egdenor in Barrowholm
