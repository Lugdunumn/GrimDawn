Arina
You shouldn't be here.
I go wherever I want.
I'm leaving.
Welcome back. Seems you're not such a stranger anymore.{^n}{^n}Perhaps the hunger drives you to keep returning to us?
Perhaps.
I don't think so.
I sense a hunger in you. You must be the shaman I've heard wisper of. {^n}{^n}Welcome to our humble village. I do hope you find it satisfactory.{^n}{^n}Tell me, do the spirits offer solace? Or have they been silent?
What's going on with this place?
Whatever do you mean?

Nevermind, what did you mean about the spirits?
You know what, never mind.
What spirits?
Oh, I've just heard that shamans sometimes commune with spirits through totemic rituals.{^n}{^n}I thought that perhaps you had experienced such a ritual for yourself and had insight.
Can't say I have.
Oh, then you should try it for yourself.{^n}{^n}I hear it can be quite...enlightening.

I'll consider it.
Not really my thing.

None of your business.
I'm sorry, I need to go.
I need to go.
You must be the strange new visitor. I've heard whispers of your arrival. {^n}{^n}What can I do for you?
What's going on with this place?
Whatever do you mean?
This village, how is it in such good shape?
Well stranger, we are very devoted.{^n}{^n}We work hard and our caring leader provides us with everything we need.
You mean Scorv Egdenor?
Yes...of course. We have, all of us, devoted ourselves to him.{^n}{^n}In return he gives us safety and satiates our hunger.{^n}{^n}You should eat before your leave. I'd hate to see you starve to death out there in the bog.{^n}{^n}Or worse, you could end up as someone's dinner.
That sounded like a threat.
Certainly not. Hunger is a powerful thing.{^n}{^n}You must feed it or it may drive you mad. It's a lesson the fleshcrazed of the bog certainly take to heart.
I'll keep that in mind.
Sounds like crazy talk to me.
Thank you for the warning.
I have to get going.
You know what, never mind.
Nothing, I need to go.
