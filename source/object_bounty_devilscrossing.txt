Reanimators are the harbingers of the Aetherial invasion. They supply the enemy with reinforcements and spread corruption with every step.{^n}{^n}If you thin their numbers, then that should give the guards of Devil's Crossing a much needed reprieve.{^n}{^n}You will be suitably rewarded with iron bits.

Nicholas Balthazar was once on death row here at Devil's Crossing for countless brutal murders.{^n}{^n}As with the other inmates, Nicholas is now free and hiding somewhere in the Arkovian Foothills, perhaps in the mines?{^n}{^n}It is time to finish his prison sentence, for good. Compensation will be offered in the form of iron bits.

Next Bounty.

Darius Cronley has performed atrocious experiments upon his lackeys with the use of Aether crystals.{^n}{^n}These men now exhibit superhuman strength and speed, but at a terrible price.{^n}{^n}We cannot risk them ever setting foot in Devil's Crossing. Eliminate them.{^n}{^n}The prison is short on supplies, but we will set aside some materials for anyone that deals with this threat.

Next Bounty.

Darius Cronley's closest lieutenants are some of the most vicious and deadly men that escaped the prison after the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}For now they seem content to remain in the Four Hills in Old Arkovia, and the mines below, but should they ever lead an attack on Devil's Crossing, the casualties would be severe.{^n}{^n}This threat must be dealt with directly. A stash of iron bits awaits anyone that claims their lives.

Next Bounty.

Cronley's recruited all manner of cruel and despicable men to his cause, not the least of which is a bastard known as "The Bruiser" Romanov.{^n}{^n}Romanov takes savage pleasure in smashing in people's skulls whenever they displease him. Cronley seems to encourage the behavior. To make matters worse, Romanov now appears to be a part of Cronley's inner circle, tainted with Aether crystals that grant him inhuman strength.He is rarely seen away from his boss in the mines below the Four Hills in Old Arkovia. Devil's Crossing has prepared a hefty sum of iron bits to see Romanov put to justice.

For the first time since evading capture back before the Grim Dawn, Bolla "The Raven" has been spotted out in the Arkovian Foothills. Last known location: Staunton Mines.{^n}{^n}Many in Burrwitch have suffered from her cruel use of the occult. It would put many minds at ease if she were eliminated.{^n}{^n}The prison is short on supplies, but we will set aside some materials for anyone that deals with this threat.

The slith are notorious for poisoning water supplies with the venomous excretions of their matriarchs.{^n}{^n}One such matriarch, Slathra the Plagued, has been spotted coming in and out of a cavern in the Foggy Bank.{^n}{^n}It is imperative that she is slain before she has a chance to befoul what little fresh water we have left.{^n}{^n}The prison is short on supplies, but we will set aside some materials for anyone that deals with this threat.

Ballior was once a joyful older man who managed a bakery in Burrwitch. Sadly, he fell when the Aetherials attacked.{^n}{^n}I dread to think of what the Aetherials had done to his remains when they dragged him into a cellar. It would ease my heart to know that he is at peace.{^n}{^n}I do not have much to offer, but I've set aside some materials for anyone that puts Ballior to rest.

Next Bounty.

Igor "The Brawler" was a brutal man with more muscle than brains back before the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Now rumor is that he's accepted Cronley's Aether crystals to become even stronger. If such a beast of a man ever decides to attack Devil's Crossing, he could cause some serious harm.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down the Brawler in Cronley's Hideout and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.

It was no secret that Caspis was a blood-drinker and devout of Ch'thon. What is unfortunate is that he survived the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Reports have come in of Caspis capturing travelers out in the Burrwitch Outskirts. It's unlikely that he's working alone, so there has to be a gathering of cultists somewhere in the area.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down Caspis to his hideout and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.

Kasparov is up to yet another of his experiments.{^n}{^n}This time, he requires some Aether Crystals in order to study their effects on the riftgate after managing to disintegrate his existing collection.{^n}{^n}The prison is short on supplies, but we will set aside some materials for anyone that supplies Kasparov with what he needs.
Accept the Bounty.

Kasparov is interested in studying some of the old pre-Grim Dawn relics.{^n}{^n}He requests that a Calamity be created for him so that he may investigate its magical properties.{^n}{^n}Anyone that manages to obtain this rare object will be rewarded with a Blood of Ch'thon.

One of Cronley's closest lackeys has been spotted out in the Four Hills. He goes by the name Rostov, the Aetherflame.{^n}{^n}If someone this high up in the chain is seen about, then the gang may be preparing to mobilize.

Kasparov believes that he may have a solution for the Aetherial's ability to resurrect our dead.

The outlaws inhabiting the Four Hills in Old Arkovia have a favorite past-time: throwing unarmed prisoners into their pit to face off against Boris.{^n}{^n}Boris is a butcher who revels in the bloodshed. It's sickening.{^n}{^n}Whenever he's about the Four Hills, he can be found in the pit near the coast. Putting him down within his own arena would be a poetic end to the maniac.{^n}{^n}To see this through, Devil's Crossing has prepared a hefty sum of iron bits as compensation for the death of Boris.
