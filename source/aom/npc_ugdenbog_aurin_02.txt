Aurin Evelline
With Ravager at our side, none shall challenge us.
Goodbye.
Begone from this place.
Alright.
Unlike your allies, you understand my value to Ravager.{^n}{^n}If only you had been here when it mattered.
Farewell.
It wounds me that I was not selected, but I will have to find other ways to serve our master.
We must serve Ravager by other means.
You will have to accept that.
With Ravager at our side, none shall challenge us.
Goodbye.
