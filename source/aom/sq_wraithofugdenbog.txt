Help Wraith
You discovered a wraith deep within a tomb that has been overtaken by Ugdenbog's wild growth. The wraith, while able to communicate with you, seemed to be very unstable. Despite that, you offered to help it pass on peacefully beyond the veil. Ugdall believes that with enough spiritual energy, it can pierce the veil on its own. A tormented Wendigo Spirit has no place in the mortal realm, claim one from the most powerful and ancient Wendigos roaming the bog and bring it to the wraith within the Tomb of Ugdall in Ugdenbog.
