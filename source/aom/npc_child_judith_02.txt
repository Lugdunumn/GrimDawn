There's a big green monster outside the gates.{^n}{^n}I don't like it. I don't like it when the monsters are real.
We'll make them go away.
Don't worry, you're safe here.
Mr. Bourbon man said we can stay with Constance. I miss momma though.
How are you holding up?
I want to go back to the fish.
I'm sorry, but your old home is gone.
Make it come back!
I'm sorry. I can't.
This place smells funny.
Aww, you'll get used to it. It's not so bad.
I want my momma.
I'm sorry, but she won't be coming back.
You're safe now.
