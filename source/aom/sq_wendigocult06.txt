Cast Off the Flesh

The time has come to bring forth Ravager into the physical realm. The Great Wendigo Spirit demands a blood sacrifice and three members of the cult have offered themselves willingly. As reward for your faithful service, Scorv reluctantly asked you, at the behest of the Wendigo, to speak to all three and decide who will serve Ravager as a sacrifice. Be mindful of who you choose as their personalities and quirks may impart themselves upon the physical form of Ravager.
