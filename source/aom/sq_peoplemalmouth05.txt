Malmouth
Rise of the Insurgence
Assault The Enclave{^n}
Even if everything living inside the Fleshworks is exterminated, there are other Aetherials actively fighting against the survivors in Malmouth. A trio of councilmen in charge of many of the operations here in Malmouth. As such, they were valuable targets for the Aetherials invading Cairn. All three had fallen to possession and turned into heavily twisted versions of their former selves. They now reside within the Chamber of the High Council, located in a tower on the south end of Crown Hill. If Malmouth is ever to be truly secure, they must be eliminated.
