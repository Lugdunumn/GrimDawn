Malmouth
Savior
Speak to Nicoh Erin
Nicoh Erin appears to have been rescuing children from the Malmouth Candle District. You managed to convince him that the resistance can protect the children and he agreed to move them to the Sewer Hideout. You should speak to him to see how they're doing.

Kill Nicoh
Nicoh Erin claimed he was rescuing children from the Malmouth Candle District but he grew belligerent when you offered to help. He refused to move the children to safety and became violent. Do what must be done to make sure the children stay safe.


Kill Nicoh Erin

Speak to Nissa
Nicoh Erin refused to listen to reason and take the children to safety, so you did what had to be done. Speak to the young girl Nissa in the Candle District and send the children to the Resistance Hideout.
