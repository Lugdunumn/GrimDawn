*Nissa stares at you silently*
Hang in there, kid.
What did you do?{^n}{^n}Why... why did you attack Mr. Nicoh?
I'm sorry kid but you're not safe here.
We were, until you killed Mr. Nicoh.{^n}{^n}Just...don't hurt us, ok?
This won't hurt, I promise. (Open Riftgate)
I'm sorry, kid. (Open Riftgate)
Oh my gosh!{^n}{^n}Why are you fighting?{^n}{^n}Stop!
Not now, kid.
*Nissa stares at you silently*
Hang in there, kid.
