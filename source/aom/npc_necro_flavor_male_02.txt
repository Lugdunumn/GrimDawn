Ralukk
With Malkadarr's return, perhaps we can finally wipe out the Chosen and end this foolish conflict.{^n}{^n}The Aetherials will not wait while we settle our mortal disputes.
May it end swiftly.
I hope we can focus on the real enemy soon.
A rogue spirit nearly ruined a day's worth of study.{^n}{^n}I shall have to be more careful with the binding ritual in the future.
You mean you capture spirits to serve you?
But of course. Spectral servants are invaluable to our research on death and history.{^n}{^n}Sure, some spirits are accommodating, but not all are as understanding of the greater purpose we all serve.
That seems despicable.
Perhaps you do not have the stomach to do what must be done?{^n}{^n}We all have a part to play. Make sure that you do yours.
We may be allies, but I do not support your ideals.
I suppose these are desperate times.
A power I hope I can attain some day.
I see.
Farewell.
