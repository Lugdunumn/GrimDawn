Ulgrim
Who are you who marches in here like they own the place.{^n}{^n}Do you have any idea who I am?
Hang in there, Ulgrim. Help is on the way.
Who are you who marches in here like they own the place.{^n}{^n}Do you have any idea who I am?
Hang in there, Ulgrim. Help is on the way.
I had lost all hope of ever seeing the sun again.{^n}{^n}Your arrival changed all that.{^n}{^n}Let's see if we can make it out of here together.
Where should I go?
Wherever we go in this pit of despair, you must take the lead. I do not know if we'll reach Malmouth as you hope, but we can try.{^n}{^n}Clear us a path and I shall join you through the shadows. Gods know there's plenty of those here.
I'll go clear us a path.
Can I ask you something?
Oh, sure. We're only in the void.{^n}{^n}Perfect time to chat.
What happened while you were in here?
After you defeated the Loghorrean, it was forced back into the pit it spawned from, right where it had sent me.{^n}{^n}I was not about to lie down and die, so the Loghorrean and I had ourselves a final duel.{^n}{^n}It took all I had in me, and my arm's seen better days, but I dare say the fiend is finally gone for good, unless perhaps there's a worse hell than this awaiting it.

I'll go clear us a path.
What happened in the Necropolis?
As we planned, I made my way through the Tomb of the Watchers to disrupt whatever ritual the Cult of Ch'thon had begun.{^n}{^n}But I was too late, the Loghorrean had already been awakened.{^n}{^n}You arrived just in time, but the beast had it in for me. It took advantage of all the chaos to pull me into its own realm.{^n}{^n}After you apparently defeated it in the physical realm, the Loghorrean was forced back into the void, where I was waiting.

I'll go clear us a path.
Are you going to be alright?
Let's save such morbid questions for when we get out of here.{^n}{^n}I'm not dead yet, and that's what matters right now.

I'll go clear us a path.
Nevermind.
I'll clear us a path.
Yes...yes, I think I remember now.{^n}{^n}The void, it...clouds my mind. Fills my every waking thought with horrors beyond imagination.{^n}{^n}But, if you're here too, how will we get out?
We'll take the void to Malmouth.
To Malmouth? Last I passed through there, it had fallen to the Aetherials, and it wasn't a pretty sight.{^n}{^n}But if you need to get there, then there must be a good reason. Though I can't say I understand why you risked coming for me if that's the priority, not that I don't appreciate it.
We're cut off by Aetherfire. The only way is through the void.
I see. Then the only way forward is deeper.{^n}{^n}I'm afraid I'm thoroughly spent and won't be much use to you in a fight. If we're going to get out of here, you will need to clear a path.{^n}{^n}Don't worry about me, I will join you through the shadows. Gods know there's plenty of those here.
I will find us a way out.
I need some time to think.
I've already cleared a path forward.
I would hate to have you for an enemy.{^n}{^n}I'll move ahead then. See you outside the void.
I'll meet you there.
Let's talk about what happened.
Seeing as we're stuck here, I suppose we've got nowhere to be.{^n}{^n}What do you want to discuss?

What happened while you were in here?
After you defeated the Loghorrean, it was forced back into the pit it spawned from, right where it had sent me.{^n}{^n}I was not about to lie down and die, so the Loghorrean and I had ourselves a final duel.{^n}{^n}It took all I had in me, and my arm's seen better days, but I dare say the fiend is finally gone for good, unless perhaps there's a worse hell than this awaiting it.
We'll escape the void to Malmouth.

I'll be right back.

I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
Ugh, my head. I yield, friend. I yield.{^n}{^n}I remember you now. We were together at the Necropolis when...{^n}{^n}The void, it...clouds my mind. Fills my every waking thought with horrors beyond imagination.{^n}{^n}But, if you're here too, how will we get out?


Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
Is that you, mother?{^n}{^n}I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I won't make it to dinner.{^n}{^n}I'm just so tired...too...tired...
Ulgrim, what happened to you?
An unfortunate accident, my emperor. I'm afraid my left arm will take some time to heal, but it should not impede my duties.{^n}{^n}It is not a concern that should rise above the threats to the empire, however.


The Loghorrean did that to you?


Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
What happened here?
The Loghorrean and I had ourselves our final dance.{^n}{^n}I mostly took the lead, but he proved to be a handful of a partner. Together we made a royal mess of this place.{^n}{^n}I'm sorry for the trouble. I'll happily pay the cleaning fees.
So it's dead for good?
Why, I certainly hope so.{^n}{^n}How many times do you have to kill a bastard before he stays down?



Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.



Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
Snap out of it, Ulgrim.
As you command.{^n}{^n}My emperor, your son lives, I made certain of it.{^n}{^n}He is safe in a secure location of which only I know.{^n}{^n}Your line will live on beyond this tragedy. I swear it.
You have to listen to me, you're in trouble.
Ah, trouble. She and I go way back. Waaay back.{^n}{^n}Did you know I slept with the Grand Inquisitor's wife once? She was a plump one, but feisty.
Ulgrim, you're in the void.
The void? That's ridiculous.{^n}{^n}Nothing living survives in the void.{^n}{^n}Are you an agent of Ch'thon here to lure me into a trap? I'll have you know I am well experienced in the art of murder.


I hate to do this, maybe I can beat some sense into you. (Attack)
Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.


Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
I'm not the emperor, Ulgrim.
Ulgrim, I haven't gone by that name in so many years...{^n}{^n}How do you know this name?
I'm your friend, I'm here to help you.

It was the name you gave me back in Burrwitch.
Burrwitch? There's nobody living left in Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}You must be another memory, haunting me in my nightmares.{^n}{^n}Begone!
You have to listen to me!
The only one who would dare to command me was the emperor, and he lies dead in the capital. His blood remains on my hands to this day.{^n}{^n}I would not take this tone with me if I were you.
I hate to do this, maybe I can beat some sense into you. (Attack)
Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.


I hate to do this, maybe I can beat some sense into you. (Attack)
Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
Your emperor commands you to stand.
Wait...my mind is clearing of some haze. You're not the emperor!{^n}{^n}You are an impostor. Why are you lying to me?{^n}{^n}Speak or meet my blade!

I'm sorry, Ulgrim, it's just me.

I hate to do this, maybe I can beat some sense into you. (Attack)
Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.


Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
Hang in there, Ulgrim. I'm coming right back.
Who are you who marches in here like they own the place.{^n}{^n}Do you have any idea who I am?
Hang in there, Ulgrim. Help is on the way.
