Blessed welcome, traveler.{^n}{^n}By His will alone did we meet this day, and that in itself is cause for celebration.

Um, ok.
Farewell.
You have scorned the Great One, heathen.{^n}{^n}There is no place for you here.
I'll be leaving.
Blood shall spill and the Great One shall feast.{^n}{^n}We are all but servants before him.
So about those travelers...
Mmm, yes, they were quite filling, but nothing good lasts forever.{^n}{^n}Soon enough, we'll have to find more.
Think I'm gonna be sick.
I don't want to know.
Good to know.
Getting out of here.
Blessed day, friend.{^n}{^n}May we all bask in the Great One's glory.
How are the survivors doing?
Oh they've been absolutely great, filling their roles in our little village just fine.{^n}{^n}We've been starved for some fresh arrivals until you came.
I see.
Farewell.
Blessed welcome, traveler.{^n}{^n}By His will alone did we meet this day, and that in itself is cause for celebration.

Um, ok.
Farewell.
The travelers you rescued arrived just before you returned.{^n}{^n}I must thank you for your aid. It seems it was not going to be long before they became food for those savages. They will be much better suited here.
Seemed like the right thing to do.
The Great One will take note of what you did this day, I am sure of it.{^n}{^n}I'll let Scorv know that you've done us all a great service.
Great, where are the survivors?
They were so terrified, those poor things.{^n}{^n}We took them inside the cellars to get some fresh clothes, feed them a bowl of Aurin's soup and get them rested for tomorrow.
I see.
Farewell.
Any hope for those survivors?{^n}{^n}Please help bring them into our fold. This village longs to be full again.
Where are these camps?
The camps you should seek out are in the northern Ugdenbog, beyond this village.{^n}{^n}Do not waste time, the cannibals are not likely to spare their prey for long.
I'll get on it now.
I'm still looking.
So I'm told that you and Scorv have come to an agreement.{^n}{^n}Rather unusual, but I am happy to serve as he wishes.
Scorv said you need some help?
Why yes, there is a small matter of growing our numbers, otherwise we may not be able to sustain ourselves.{^n}{^n}Travelers around these parts are rare nowadays, made all the worse by the spreading aetherfire to the north; but another obstacle is the rampaging cannibals in the northern Ugdenbog.{^n}{^n}Please, do us this favor: seek out the camps of these bloodthirsty fiends and rescue any survivors still drawing breath.
Sure, I'll rescue those people.
Sounds too dangerous.
We'll speak later.
Blessed welcome, traveler.{^n}{^n}By His will alone did we meet this day, and that in itself is cause for celebration.
Oh? And which god is that?
Oh, that's not important.{^n}{^n}The Great One has seen to it that we all have our fill.
I...see.
Um, ok.
Farewell.
