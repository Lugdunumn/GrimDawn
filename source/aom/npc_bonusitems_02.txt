Lancel the Knight
Greetings!{^n}{^n}I am Lancel, and I've traveled the world in search of one worthy of my collection.{^n}{^n}Are you such a one?
I am feeling knightly.
As you should!{^n}{^n}But are you in more of a silver mood...or perhaps something a bit more sinister?
The silver armaments!
A fine choice.{^n}{^n}I might say it's my favorite choice!
(Receive Illusion: Silver Knight)
The black armaments!
Hm, can't say it's what I would go with, but who am I to judge?
(Receive Illusion: Black Knight)
What was the most impressive thing you've seen?
It was a splendid sight.{^n}{^n}He fought as if he were a ferocious beast. His spear cut through foes in a blur.{^n}{^n}This armor is now all that remains of the venerable warrior.
(Receive Illusion: Dragon General)
Have you met any wizards in your travels?
Indeed I have. Powerful beings they are, not to be trifled with.{^n}{^n}Some are good...others...not so much.
Tell me of the White Wizard!
Ah yes, he was very wise, very ancient...but an enigmatic fellow.{^n}{^n}He told me to fly.
(Receive Illusion: White Wizard)
Tell me of the Dark Wizard!
His very presence sent chills down my spine.{^n}{^n}He dabbled in powers we are not meant to seek and bound many to darkness.{^n}{^n}I would not follow in his footsteps.
(Receive Illusions: Dark Wizard)
I could use a companion.
This is a lonely world, it helps to have a friend.
I'll take the sacred crate.
This creature is a symbol of great fortune in many cultures.{^n}{^n}Treat it well.
(Receive Item: Sacred Crate)
I'm tired of these Illusions.
I understand. Looking this good can become quite the burden.
(Receive Item: Illusion-Be-Gone)
Then start fresh with Illusion-Be-Gone!
True, I already have that.
Um, ok. Goodbye.
