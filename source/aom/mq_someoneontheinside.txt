The Liberation of Malmouth
Someone on the Inside
Lower the Bridge
It seems a small group of refugees led by what's left of the city's wardens has managed to cobble together a meager resistance. They've rescued as many of the city's survivors as they could but they just don't have enough manpower. Enter the Candle District through the rebel's hideout, find your way through the slums and lower the city bridge so Creed and the Black Legion can assist in reclaiming Malmouth. 




Enter the Candle District and Lower the City Bridge



Speak with Creed{^n}
With the bridge lowered, the Black Legion can enter Malmouth and begin supporting the resistance. Report in to Inquisitor Creed near the riftgate on the far side of the bridge.

Resistance Meet and Greet
Inquisitor creed wants to speak with the resistance leader to find out more about what's happening to the city and how they can be helped. Meet them in the city sewers at the Resistance Hideout.
