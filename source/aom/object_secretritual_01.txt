Bound Spirit
Great gifts you bring me, mortal.{^n}{^n}Are you certain you wish to proceed? Doomed are all who pursue the master's sanctum without invitation.
Give the gifts.
Step away.
Foolish you are, mortal, to seek the master's sanctum.{^n}{^n}But if death is what you desire, than I shall not stop you. Bring me three gifts and I shall open the way.{^n}{^n}First, I desire a witch's pendant. Second, a source of great darkness. And last, a weapon forged by the dead master.{^n}{^n}Return with the gifts or do not return at all.
But I have this sword.
Don't make me laugh, mortal.{^n}{^n}This petty trinket is not worthy of the place you seek.{^n}{^n}Find me something more...mythical.
So where will I find that?

*The spirit stares at you silently*

(Step Away)
The master?
He is as if a god to the likes of you.{^n}{^n}But he enjoys his mortal playthings. Perhaps he will find some use of you before your corpse is discarded.
