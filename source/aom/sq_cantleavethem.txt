Malmouth
Can't Leave Them
Find Women
Rivia at the Resistance Hideout is concerned for the people of Malmouth that never made it to the sewers in time, particularly the women. The Aetherials seem to have taken a strange interest in women in particular. She believes some of them may still survive within the Aetherial Fleshworks. She understands that what she asks of you is incredibly dangerous, but she wants to save those women and thinks you are the only one who could.
