Barrowholm
Meddling Witch
Slay Witch
Larria the Hexxer is a witch living underneath a great tree to the south of Barrowholm. Unlike her sisters who remain mostly secluded in their little refuge, Larria actively clashes with the Ravager's great vision. It is time that her meddling be put to an end. Find Larria's Den within Ugdenbog and eliminate her.
