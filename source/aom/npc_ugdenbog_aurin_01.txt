Aurin Evelline
Welcome to Barrowholm, traveler.
Farewell.
Begone from this place.
Alright.
You look a bit skinny, have you been eating enough?{^n}{^n}Doesn't hurt to be a little tender.
I found this recipe written by you.
Ah, that old thing. I love coming up with new ways to prepare meat.{^n}{^n}Lately I've been experimenting with serving it more raw, more...off the bone.{^n}{^n}If you'll stay with us, I'd love to serve you some time.
Perhaps another time.
Um, right.
Goodbye.

What a beautiful village.
Why, thank you.{^n}{^n}We try to keep some normalcy in our lives despite all the tragedy.{^n}{^n}We don't see as many visitors here as we used to, but you are welcome to stay as long as you'd like.

Thank you.
Actually, I was just passing through.
