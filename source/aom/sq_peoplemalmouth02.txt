Arming the Resistance
Gather Supplies
In order to fight back, the Aetherial needs to arm its resistance fighters. Without easy access to the forges and arcane circles, the resistance cannot simply forge new weapons. They have to rely on scavenging. Captain Wilfor's scavengers have become aware of two such stashes out among the ruins of the rowhouses in the Steelcap District. Recover these for the resistance.
