Nissa
I miss Mr. Nicoh.
I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.
Mr. Nicoh was there for us when everybody else ran.{^n}{^n}And now he's dead...{^n}{^n}*Nissa starts crying*
I'm sorry...
Get over it.
Get over it.
*Nissa smiles at you*
Stay safe, kid.
*Nissa is looking around, absorbing her surroundings silently.*
Stay safe, kid.
