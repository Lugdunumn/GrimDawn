Wuulavia
Take heed, traveler. The wendigo spirit is strong in these parts.
The wendigo spirit?
It is an ancient spirit of the forest; once fierce and noble, it has become lost to the darkness. Lost even to Mogdrogen.{^n}{^n}Now it only seeks to corrupt all it touches.
Mogdrogen?
He is the patron god of the forest and guardian of the Rhowari, our people.
I see.
Thank you for the warning.
Farewell.
