There was a monster, but I protected Judith, like dad would have wanted.
Good kid, but be careful.

Good kid, but be careful.
You're really brave! Someday I want to be brave like you.
Take care.
Cronley was scary. Thank you for bringing us here.
You're welcome.
Dad said I should look out for Judith. So I will!

Good idea. Take care now.

Just listen to what Constance tells you.
That's a good kid.
Take care.
