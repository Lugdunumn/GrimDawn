Malmouth
The Blackiron Docks
Secure Docks
Korinia has been stepping up the resistance's effort to take back the city and feels that they are now ready to tackle a larger target: the Blackiron Docks within the harbor of the Steelcap District. She wishes for you to take the lead on this dangerous mission and ensure that the people of Malmouth have a major victory to rally around.


Secure the Blackiron Docks


Speak to Korinia
You have secured the docks alongside the Malmouth Resistance and should report back to Korinia back at the Resistance Hideout.
