Find Memory
Ivonda is a survivor at the Resistance Hideout in Malmouth, but she doesn't seem to quite be all there. She was rambling on about some treasure she stashed away before the attacks, but she's forgotten where. You can help her by finding whatever reminder she had left for herself, but where is that even?
