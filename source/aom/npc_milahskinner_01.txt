If you need somebody to help and fight, you just let me know!
I think we have enough willing fighters, you go on and play.
I'll keep you in mind!
Thanks for the new home! Daddy seems all better too. He always said there were no more good people left in the world, but now I think he's wrong.{^n}{^n}*Milah smiles at you*
You're welcome.
