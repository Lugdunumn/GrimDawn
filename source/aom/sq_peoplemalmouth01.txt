Malmouth
Bring Out Your Dead
Destroy Corpse Wagons
Captain Wilfor has informed you of a despicable act the Aetherials are performing across Malmouth. The bodies of the dead are rounded up and transported to Crown Hill via wagons loaded up in the Candle District. It's become quite abundantly clear what the bodies are used for, so any chance to sabotage that supply chain is in everybody's benefit.
Destroy the northern Wagon
Destroy the southern Wagon
Destroy the eastern Wagon

Return to Captain
You have sabotaged the corpse wagons and should report back to Captain Wilfor at the Resistance Hideout
Speak to Captain Wilfor in the Resistance Hideout
