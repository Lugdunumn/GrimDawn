The Liberation of Malmouth
Malmouth, the Fallen City
The Gates of Malmouth
Ulgrim is still in no state to travel but you need to reach the city of Malmouth. Make your way through the outskirts of Malmouth and look for the entrance of Malmouth to the north. A riftgate there should suffice as a rally point, clear any nearby threats and lock it down.

Speak to Ulgrim
The riftgate outside Malmouth is cleared but the bridge into the city can only be raised from the far side of the river. You need to find another way into the city. Speak with Ulgrim and find out if he knows another way in.

Survivors
Ulgrim suggested taking the sewers into the city. Just down river from the bridge is a sewer outlet that leads into the underbelly of Malmouth. Before the Grim Dawn, this route was used to smuggle contraband in and out of the Candle District. Use the sewer entrance to enter the city and search for any survivors that might know what's happening behind the city walls.

Report to Ulgrim
After scouring the city's sewers you've come across a group of refugees. They're using an old pumping station as a place to hide from the terrors up on the surface. Report to Ulgrim outside the refugee camp to figure out your next move.
