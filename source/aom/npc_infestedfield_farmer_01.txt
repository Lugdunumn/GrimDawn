Oliver Thornsbury
*Oliver sighs*{^n}{^n}Don't suppose you've seen my wife, Daila, around. Have you?{^n}{^n}Don't tell me she's run off on another of her stories...
I...think she's run off to Malmouth.
What?!{^n}{^n}But...she...how...I...{^n}{^n}By the gods, that girl will be the death of me.{^n}{^n}If you see her again, please tell her to come home. Malmouth is no place for a young lady to be off on her own, especially now.

I'll let her know.
I think she'll be just fine.
Does this happen often?
Too often, I'd say.{^n}{^n}The world is crumbling around us and the girl's head is in the clouds.{^n}{^n}*Oliver sighs again*{^n}{^n}She doesn't appreciate how much she makes me worry.
I...think she's run off to Malmouth.

Hope she comes home soon then.
Sorry, I haven't.
I heard from Douglass that my farm has been cleared of the infestation. Don't suppose I have you to thank for that?
I found your wife's diary. It has some interesting stories in there.

Good luck out there.
I hope it's a good harvest.
Blasted Dermapterans. An entire year's worth of food is gonna go to waste out there.
Why hasn't the Black Legion cleared them out?
Hell if I know. Somer's only concerned with her war against the Aetherials. Then there's that blasted cult.{^n}{^n}I'm no soldier, so I suppose I'll just keep my mouth shut and work the fields we do have.
I see.
I found your wife's diary. It has some interesting stories in there.
Oh, not again. Does she fly in this one? Her head is up in the clouds when we need it back down here.{^n}{^n}*Oliver sighs*{^n}{^n}Then again, we could all use a distraction these days. Maybe it will help her deal with all this tragedy.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
