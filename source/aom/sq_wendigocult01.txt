Barrowholm
Wendigo Wards
Restore Wards
One of Barrowholm's shamans had set up various wards around the perimeter of the village in an effort to scare off the vile inhabitants of the bog. Some of those totems are now failing. Tyvald has asked you to step out into the wilderness and restore those wards. They are spread out on the outskirts of the village.
Restore the Northern Ward
Restore the Eastern Ward
Restore the Southern Ward

Return to Tyvald
You have restored the wards.{^n}{^n}Return to Tyvald in Barrowholm with the good news.
