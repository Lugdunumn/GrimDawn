Leora Karns
Thank Solael you found us when you did.{^n}{^n}I saw those things rip a man apart and devour him. I'm sure it wouldn't have been long before it was my turn.
What were those things?
Some of them looked almost human...or what used to be human.{^n}{^n}I'm not too familiar with curses, but perhaps that is what's happening here?
You should be safe here.
I know the coven will protect us, but I just can't stand to think about those ghastly things coming after us again. 



If I see more of them, I'll make sure they pay.
Don't worry, you're safe now.



Farewell.
So you are a new recruit?
Yes, like the others you saved. We were called here.
Called here?
Like a voice in your head, calling you home. {^n}{^n}I know it sounds strange but, after the Grim Dawn, I got this feeling. {^n}{^n}I could sense something reaching out to me from this place. I just, I knew exactly what I needed to do. As it turned out, it was Matron Malostria calling to others like her through the aether.
So you came here to join the coven?
Yes, and I wouldn't have made it without your help. Thank you.



I'm glad I could help.
Fascinating.



Farewell.
The Three have become silent.
How can you say such things when it is their guidance that kept me alive all these years?{^n}{^n}I would be nothing if not for the blessings of Solael.


Believe what you want.
If it makes you feel better.
Solael?
Yes, the divine gods of the eldritch realm watch over us all and bless us with powers unimaginable.{^n}{^n}Solael is my patron and to whom I swear my life.


I see.
Take care.
By the Three, this place is more than I could have hoped for.
