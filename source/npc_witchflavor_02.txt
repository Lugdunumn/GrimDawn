Lagarria
Hey there, you look like a tough one.{^n}{^n}It's nice to see a fellow [[ms]man[fs]woman] of action out here.
What does that mean?
Well, my sisters don't have a lot of respect for those of us who abstain from the arcane in favor of getting into the thick of it and coated in blood.{^n}{^n}I say a little magic is a good thing, but when it comes down to it nothing beats a big stick or a sharp blade.
What are you doing up here?
It's my job to keep Garradia safe, whether from humans, beasts or the occasional spirit.

Keep up the good work.


I see. Farewell.

I'll be on my way.
Hey there, can I help you?
What are you doing up here?
I'm Garradia's bogyguard. I go where she goes.{^n}{^n}You're not looking to cause any trouble are you?
Certainly not.
Good, because I'd hate to sully that pretty face of yours.
And if I am looking for trouble? 


I'll take that as a compliment.
And if I am?
Then you've come to the right place.{^n}{^n}I could use a bit of a workout, but you don't seem like the troublemaking type.
You're right, I'm not.
Oh, I see.{^n}{^n}You're trying to rile me up. Well, congratulations now I'm ready for a fight.


My work here is done.
I'm sorry, I'll be going now.
I'll be going.
No, I don't think I am.
What can you tell me about the coven?
Well, I haven't been here long, so there isn't much I could tell you.{^n}{^n}Shortly following the Grim Dawn, I had a bad run in with some bastards looking for easy pickings. Unfortunately for them, I didn't qualify. Unfortunately for me, there were four of them and I didn't exactly make it out unscathed. Garradia found me alone and slowly dying to my injuries. She brought me here to tend to my wounds.{^n}{^n}When I was healed, she said I could stay here and train with the others. I owe her my life.{^n}I always had a penchant for violence, so I suppose my role just came naturally to me.
A noble pursuit.
Nobody in my life had ever shown me the kindness that Garradia has.{^n}{^n}There isn't anything I wouldn't do for her.


Farewell.


Farewell.
You seem friendlier than others I've spoken to.
I don't immediately assume every stranger is an enemy, though a healthy bit of skepticism helps these days.{^n}{^n}Don't mistake my demeanor for softness though. Touch Garradia and you're a dead [[ms]man[fs]woman].


Fair enough.
Just passing through.
I'm sorry, but if you have business here you should speak with Garradia.
I will, thank you.
