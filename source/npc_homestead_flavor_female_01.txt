Daila Thornsbury
I've been, um, writing again.{^n}{^n}*Daila blushes*{^n}{^n}I hope you don't mind, but I wrote you into the story.
I, um, found the sword, Stormheart.
You what?!{^n}{^n}*Daila pauses, contemplating*{^n}{^n}That cannot be. It's just something I made up in my stories.
I think you should keep it.
What? No, no, I can't take it. A sword like that probably has some history. A girl walking around with a thing like that, just asks for attention.{^n}{^n}You found it. You should keep it.

Very well. I will use it well.
Don't worry, I'll take good care of your blade. (Wink)
Those stories of yours...they're not really just stories, are they?
I don't know what you mean. Of course they're just stories.{^n}{^n}Imagine a girl like me swinging a sword like that. It'd be a disaster.
You should take the sword.
Yeah, I suppose that's pretty ridiculous.
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. (Wink)
Pretty unebelievable, right?
I know about Dravis, Daila. I know where he's been.
I honestly do not know of what you speak, friend, but if the Dravis from my stories was actually real, you would be smart to avoid him.{^n}{^n}He is as ruthless as he is determined and he will stop at nothing to get revenge on ou...his father.
Please, stop dodging the subject.
I'm really starting to dislike your character in my story.{^n}{^n}[[ms]He[fs]She] is really pushy.

Very well.
Fine, I'll drop it.
But we have to do something about this.
Some stones are better left unturned and some urns...better left unbroken.{^n}{^n}I don't know who you think I may be, but whatever it is you are meddling with is better left alone.
This will catch up to you sooner or later.
Fine, I'll drop it.
I'll be careful.
Fine, I'll drop it.
Sure, but I better not die at the end.
Just make sure my character's really buff.
I really don't want to know.
Thank you for returning my diary to me.{^n}{^n}It might seem silly, but writing helps me relax; even now, with the world as it is.


Farewell.
Thank you for clearing out our farm. It's the best news I've heard in weeks.
I found your diary.
Oh heavens, I hope you didn't read it. It's not proper to stick your nose into a lady's private scribblings.{^n}{^n}Thank you, I dropped it when we fled the farm. Figured the Dermapterans would have shredded it by now.
I assure you, I have not read a word. (Lie)
Your secret is safe with me. (Wink)
You're welcome.
Please, make yourself at home.

Oh, hello there. You startled me.{^n}{^n}I'm probably not the person you're looking for. You should speak to Douglass if you require assistance.

Welcome back. It's always a pleasure.
Likewise.
