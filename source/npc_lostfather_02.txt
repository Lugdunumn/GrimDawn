This place is like a dream I can't quite shake off.{^n}{^n}It is a shame that our nightmares in Malmouth have reached even here.
Why did you ask your daughter to go ahead alone?
We were attacked by those...things. I froze up, Amala...saved me, but not before one of the wretches tore up my leg.{^n}{^n}I told her to keep going, to find safety on her own. I could have probably hobbled along but, truth is, I've had enough of these horrors. I just wanted to curl up and die.{^n}{^n}In my cowardice, I left my daughter at the mercy of nature.
Your daugher seems quite capable.
I do not know where she gets it. From her mother perhaps.{^n}{^n}She was the adventurous one...before the Aetherials took her from us.
I'm sorry.

We cannot afford to lose people like that. Every life counts.
Take care.
Anything you can tell me about Malmouth?
Malmouth was once a prosperous city, a true gem in the east. I made a modest living working in the docks, but I was just days away from making a big trade that would have made me rich. I would have bought a home in Crown Hill and brought Amelia and her mother with me.{^n}{^n}Of course, that's all gone now. Destroyed or infested with Aetherial monstrosities. That thing that attacked Devil's Crossing...that's just their latest aberration, a melding of flesh and steel.{^n}Malmouth has become a factory of nightmares.

Good to know.
Take care.
After journeying through aetherfire and vile bog, this place is like a dream I can't quite shake off.
You're safe now.
