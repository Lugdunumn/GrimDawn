Coven of Ugdenbog
Power in the Circles
Activate The Totems
There is power in circles, or so Matron Malostria says. She has implored you to seek out the circles of power in Ugdenbog, near the Coven's Refuge, and release the vile spirits trapped within them. Slay the spirits and cleanse the circles in preparation for Malostria's protective ritual.


Cleanse the Eastern Circle
Cleanse the Northern Circle
Cleanse the Western Circle


Return to Matron
You have prepared the three circles of power, as Matron Malostria had instructed. Return to her at the Coven's Refuge.
Speak to Matron Malostria at the Coven's Refuge
