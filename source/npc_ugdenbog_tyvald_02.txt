Tyvald Hallows
None will stand in our way now.
Goodbye.
Not even your efforts were enough to thwart us.{^n}{^n}Begone from this place before I end you.
I'm leaving.
It is a pity that not all share in your vision.{^n}{^n}I would have been the superior offering to the great Ravager!
It is a shame.
It pleases me that Ravager has returned, but I cannot help feel as if my own destiny was not realized.{^n}{^n}I wish to spill blood in his honor and feast upon the flesh of our fallen foes!
What will you do now?
Honestly, I do not know.{^n}{^n}I've been preparing for this moment for months and now that it's here, I feel so...empty...{^n}{^n}Not even the taste of flesh quells my unrest.
Farewell.
We must serve Ravager by other means.
You will have to accept that.
None will stand in our way now.
Goodbye.
