Ulgrim
Good work up there.{^n}{^n}One district at a time, we'll take this city back.
Indeed.
Be careful up there.{^n}{^n}We have no idea what else the Aetherials have brewed in their fortress.
I'll be careful.
It's good to have Creed here. He's got a mind for battlefield tactics.{^n}{^n}I hope these refugees cooperate. We don't have time for politics.
Farewell.
I knew the situation here was bad but...when your only option is a sewer...
Gotta start somewhere.
Good work with the bridge, but you shouldn't keep Creed waiting.
I'll speak to him now.
How are the slums treating you?
What should I be doing?
You need to make your way through the Candle District, a sewer passage leading there is not far.{^n}{^n}Use the bridge controls to open the way into the city for Creed and the Black Legion.{^n}
On it.
About how you'd expect.
So this is what's left of the resistance then.{^n}{^n}We're going to need the Legion.{^n}{^n}Wait, did I just say that? Somer must have rubbed off on me.
Wilfor mentioned bridge controls.
Yes, that will suffice to let Creed's troops pour into the city proper.{^n}{^n}You will have to make your way through the Candle District, a more pleasant name for the city's slums. I don't expect it will be enjoyable.{^n}{^n}Carve your way through whatever horrors the Aetherials have waiting and bring down that bridge. In the meantime, I'll try to get what information I can out of these people, figure out what we're dealing with.
I'll make sure the bridge is lowered.
I need some time to think.
The bridge is already down.
Well, what are you waiting for then?{^n}{^n}If you've secured the way, then Creed will have brought in the troops. Find him outside the city and let him know we're down here.
On it.
I'll be back.
So this is what's left of the resistance then.{^n}{^n}We're going to need the Legion.{^n}{^n}Wait, did I just say that? Somer must have rubbed off on me.
Wilfor mentioned bridge controls.
