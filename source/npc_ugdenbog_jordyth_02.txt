We all stand within the awe-inspiring presence of a god.{^n}{^n}You should kneel.
I was just leaving.
Don't worry, heathen, I shall grant you a merciful end.{^n}{^n}Though what parts to start with? The legs, or the arms? They both have their tender parts.
I'll be leaving.
It surprises me that you, an outsider, had the vision to understand just how devoted I am to our god, but yet I was not chosen.{^n}{^n}I am ashamed that it was not my duty to serve in this task, but I shall strive to do better. I will become His servant in all things.
It is too bad.
Glorious Ravager has been brought into this world, just as Scorv promised.{^n}{^n}I am shamed that it was not my duty to serve in this task, but I shall strive to do better. I will become His servant in all things.
We must serve Ravager by other means.
You will have to accept that.
We all stand within the awe-inspiring presence of a god.{^n}{^n}You should kneel.
I was just leaving.
