Liberate the Liberators
Rescue The Resistance
Several members of the Resistance never returned from their recent excurson into Aetherial territory. Captain Wilfor wasn't sure they'd be up to the task, and it appears he was correct. Unfortunately it now means that a scavenging operation in the Steelcrap District has turned into a rescue. Find Hyram and Nadia along with any other survivors, if they are still alive.
