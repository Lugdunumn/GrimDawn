So another monster has been banished from this world.{^n}{^n}You're beginning to give me hope that someday there will be an end to all this tragedy.
We can only hope.
Anything to report on the situation in Malmouth?
No good news yet.
We'll talk later.
So that's what it's gonna take then? The void?{^n}{^n}Can't say I envy you.
We have no choice.
I hope you know what you're doing, trusting those witches.{^n}{^n}I have faith in you and Creed, but I find these methods...unsettling.
The Coven has good people, just misunderstood.
I'll do whatever it takes to keep us safe.
It's a necessary evil.
Good luck out in Ugdenbog. I've only traveled north of Burrwitch a handful of times and the journey was never a pleasant one.{^n}{^n}I cannot imagine it's fared any better with a lack of patrols and human activity.
Anything I should be aware of?
Gloomwald and Ugdenbog are some of the most treacherous areas in the region, even before the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Regular patrols kept the roads mostly safe for travel, but there was always a risk when traveling between Burrwitch and the northern settlements. Those that could afford it generally preferred to go by boat.{^n}{^n}I don't know what it is about that bog, but it's a breeding ground for predators.

Good to know.
What's next for Devil's Crossing?
We're going to clean up this mess, tighten our defenses.{^n}{^n}Prepare for the worst.{^n}{^n}As always, we will persevere.

We will endure.
Farewell.
I knew that eliminating Krieg would not be the end of our troubles, but I never pictured this.
What's next for Devil's Crossing?
We're going to clean up this mess, tighten our defenses.{^n}{^n}Prepare for the worst.{^n}{^n}As always, we will persevere.
We will endure.
Farewell.
