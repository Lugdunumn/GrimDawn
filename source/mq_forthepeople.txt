The Liberation of Malmouth
For the People
Help the Rebels
Korinia, the resistance leader, has informed Creed of an old base of operations up in the Steelcap District. Inquisitor Creed thinks this may be a way to gain a foothold in the city and launch a counter-attack on the Aetherials. Reach the Steelcap District through the city sewers and help the resistance fighters retake their base. 




Retake the base in the Steelcap District



Report to Creed
The battle for the resistance base was successful. Though the base appears to have been heavily damaged, it is secure enough for now. There's a lot of work to be done before it's fully operational. Speak to Inquisitor Creed and find out what he's planning next.
