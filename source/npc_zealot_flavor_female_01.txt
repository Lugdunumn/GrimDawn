Sister Thaddia
You truly are a Chosen of Kymon.{^n}{^n}Empyrion will surely reward your faithful service.
Farewell.
Through Empyrion, all is possible.
Empyrion?
The Lightbringer, the Eternal Flame. Empyrion is the savior of humanity, returned to us in our darkest hour.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon communes with Empyrion, delivering the Divine One's will to his Chosen.
How do I commune with Empyrion?
Empyrion only speaks to Father Kymon.{^n}{^n}We are not permitted to disturb him during his visions.
Seems awfully convenient.
Do you not have faith? None who have witnessed Father Kymon's work would dare question his connection with Empyrion.{^n}{^n}The Blessed Father has walked through flame and emerged unscathed. His very touch banishes Chthonians to the void.{^n}{^n}It is an honor and a privilege to be one of his Chosen.
I will have to see it for myself.
I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions.
Farewell.
Farewell.
What's behind this gate?
Father Kymon's personal study, where he communes with Empyrion.{^n}{^n}No one is permitted inside except the Father.

I see.
Farewell.
Welcome [[ms]brother[fs]sister]. May Empyrion be your light in the encroaching darkness.

Farewell.
