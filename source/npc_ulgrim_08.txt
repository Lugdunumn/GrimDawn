Ulgrim
It's good to see the sun again.
Goodbye.
It's good to see the sun again.
Goodbye.
I'm sorry I cannot be of more assistance.{^n}{^n}I'll be sure to carve a few Aetherial skulls for you when I'm not on the verge of vomiting up black sludge.
Where do we need to go?
If my bearings are correct, the gates to Malmouth are to the north of here.{^n}{^n}Find and secure another riftgate and I shall join you.

Alright.
Are you going to be alright?
I haven't exactly been stuck in the void for days before, but my best guess is yes, I'll get through this.

Don't you die on me after all that.
Hang in there, Ulgrim.
I'm sure you will.
Hang in there, Ulgrim.
While that unpleasantness is behind us, it seems we're stepping right into another. This area has changed since I've last seen it.
Do you know this place?
To the north is Malmouth, of that I am sure. But it seems we're not the only ones with sights set upon the fallen city.{^n}{^n}What remains of the Cult of Ch'thon is thick here, battling with our mutual enemy for control over the city outskirts. I'm afraid I see no choice but to wade into that battlefield and carve a path to the city gates.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherials entrenched here, I am certain there's another riftgate around. Find it, secure it, and I will join you.
I'm on it. Wait here.
There has to be another way.
I've already secured a way forward.
Good thinking.{^n}{^n}Let's meet there and analyze the mess we've got ourselves in.
I'll meet you there.
I'll be right back.
It's good to see the sun again.{^n}{^n}And I have you to thank for it.
We have to keep moving.
You're right, of course.{^n}{^n}But you have to fill me in, why are you trying to get into Aetherial territory?
A survivor from Malmouth warned us of something awful.
Oh...great!{^n}{^n}While the unpleasantness in the void is behind us, it seems we're stepping right into another. This area has changed since I've last seen it.
Do you know this place?

I'll be right back.
It's good to see the sun again.
Goodbye.
