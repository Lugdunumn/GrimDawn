Secure Riftgate
The people of Corrigan Mine had discovered a riftgate shortly after their arrival in the salt mine. Taking the cautious approach, they sealed off that part of the mine in hopes that it would keep the camp safe. It worked to an extent, but that mineshaft is overflowing with monstrosities, some of which occasionally make it to the camp. If you clear the mineshaft and secure the riftgate, then the miners will clear the way, granting you easy access to their camp via the riftgate.
