Jagged Waste
The Gloomweaver
Kill Spider
You have proven yourself against Mogara, so Deathmark Vallar has entrusted you with the elimination of another highly dangerous pest. A great spider known as Ungoliax the Gloomweaver has her lair somewhere within the Shaded Basin, to the south of his camp in the Pine Barrens. Her spawn crawl out of the darkest places of the world in order to terrorize the locals and gather food for their ravenous queen. This must end. Seek out the lair of Ungoliax and end her life.
Slay Ungoliax in the caves of the Shaded Basin

Return to Deathmark
You have slain Ungoliax the Gloomweaver and should report back to Deathmark Vallar at his camp in the Pine Barrens.
