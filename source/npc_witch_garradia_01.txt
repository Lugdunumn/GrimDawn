Garradia
I would like to thank you on behalf of all us here at the refuge.{^n}{^n}You have done us a great service in restoring the wards.
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.


Seemed like the right thing to do.
Our matron, Malostria, has requested to speak with you.{^n}{^n}I would not keep her waiting.
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.

Where is Matron Malostria?
You will find her below us, at the center of the refuge.{^n}{^n}She is usually tending to the ritual circle we will need to restore our wards.

Thank you.

Alright.
Perhaps I was wrong about you. You are willing to look past prejudices and assist us.
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.

I have some questions.
What has captured your curiosity?
Can you tell me about the Coven's history?
Decades ago, the Coven was not nearly as inviting. It was a pact of witches dedicated to furthering their craft, performing rituals that bent the laws of reality and reached for the gates of the eldritch realm itself. Pursued relentlessly by the Luminari, the coven sought safety within the forsaken places of the world, which led them here to Ugdenbog.{^n}{^n}Their thirst for power eventually brought them to discover the location of the Altar of Rattosh, where they were able to transcend beyond rudimentary rituals, but this also drew the ire of the Three. Having foolishly reached for the realm of the gods, the coven was punished and their leaders burnt alive with eldritch fire. The rest swore off use of the altar entirely from fear of further retribution. In stark contrast to its origins, the coven became more open to who it invited into its fold and began to reach out to other witches that struggled to survive under the empire's heel. Our numbers grew and in numbers we found safety, though given your arrival we had feared the Luminari had finally caught up to us.{^n}{^n}You could try speaking to Rugia about this matter. She is the only one left among us who was alive during that time, though she may not be very open to the subject.


I have another question.
Fascinating.
Perhaps I will speak to her then.

The Three?
Yes, the three Witch Gods Bysmiel, Dreeg and Solael. They are the masters of the eldritch realm, the source of power for most witches, including myself.{^n}{^n}Some here even find solace in their worship, though I cannot say what comforts such worship brings.
I have another question.
Fascinating.

I have another question.
Fascinating.
Perhaps I will speak to her then.
Why is Ugdenbog such a treacherous place?
The harsh environment breeds tough beasts capable of withstanding it, that is nature.{^n}{^n}Though perhaps not all that has transpired within this bog is entirely natural. The Altar of Rattosh is a testament to this area's darker past.
Why do you think the altar was built here?
Perhaps because the veil between the living and the dead is thinner here. Why that is, I could not tell you.{^n}{^n}Perhaps a violent ritual once took place here that birthed something into this world?{^n}{^n}Whatever the cause, locations such as this are not too common, so there must be some correlation.
I have another question.
Interesting.
I have another question.
Perhaps.
How did you come to join the Coven?
When I was a young girl, I lived with my family in the capital city of Erulan. We led a simple life there, far from the scheming and machinations of the emperor's court. But it would not last.{^n}{^n}When I turned 11, my powers began manifesting themselves in unexpected and unnatural ways. Plants near me would begin to grow rapidly and then decay just as quickly. Random objects would burst into flame. I had no control over these displays, nor was I even sure they were my doing.{^n}{^n}My mother thought that our home had become possessed and called in a priest. But the temple did not send a priest, they sent an inquisitor, one of your kind.{^n}{^n}As soon as the woman entered our doorstep, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rising and my heart began to beat at an alarming pace. I felt that way again when you first entered our refuge. It was unsettlingly familiar. For reasons I could not even fathom at the time, I was suddenly terrified out of my mind.{^n}{^n}The inquisitor did not wait to be invited inside, she shoved my mother aside and investigated every inch of our home. At last, she came into my room. Her eyes pierced into mine and at that moment I knew that she had come for me.

I have another question.
Sorry to interrupt you, but I need to go.
I'm sorry, I cannot bear to hear the rest.

At last, she came into my room. Her eyes pierced into mine and at that moment I knew that she had come for me.
I have another question.
What happened next?
There was no hesitation, no mercy, when she unclasped the chains on her belt and reach for my hands. The runes carved into the chains glowed brightly as they neared my flesh. I cowered in the corner, tears flowing freely, but the inquisitor had no remorse.{^n}{^n}She grasped my hands free and fixed the chains around my slim wrists. The runes burnt where they touched my flesh, I still have the scars.{^n}{^n}My mother burst into the room, screaming for her to let me go. But again, the inquisitor would hear nothing on the matter. When my mother refused to let her pass, she activated yet another rune and paralyzed my mother where she stood, that was the last time I ever saw her.{^n}{^n}When we arrived at the inquisitor's carriage, she put a bag over my head and wrapped it tightly such that I could barely breathe. Unlike the runes burning into my skin, her hands were cold as ice.{^n}{^n}I do not know where I was taken, but it was a prison beyond the walls of Erulan. You would think that this is where my story should have ended, but it was not to be. One of the guards took pity on me. He could not understand how someone so young could be so much of a threat that she be locked up within that forsaken place. He helped me escape in a delivery wagon headed south.{^n}{^n}Unfortunately no solace awaited me beyond that journey. I was forced to become a street urchin, begging for or stealing food scraps wherever I could as I wandered from town to town, hitching rides with travelers whenever my powers would manifest and I was forced to flee.{^n}{^n}Eventually, I came upon an old crone named Rugia, who sensed the untamed potential within me. She took me in and together we traveled here. The refuge has been my home ever since.
I have another question.
I'm sorry you had to suffer.
Fascinating.
Sorry to interrupt you, but I need to go.
Nevermind.
You have proven to be trustworthy.
I'm glad we reached agreement.
Whatever it is you think you're doing here, you are in the wrong place.
I'll be off then.
Have you found the Undergrowth and dealt with Sylvarria?
Yes, the aberration has been slain.
Good. Perhaps in time new plant life will sprout from her remains that brings a healthy balance to the ecosystem.{^n}{^n}Our Matron, Malostria, will be pleased to hear this news.{^n}{^n}In fact, she has been inquiring about you. You should not keep her waiting.
Where is Matron Malostria?
You will find her below us, at the center of the refuge.{^n}{^n}She is usually tending to the ritual circle we will need to restore our wards.
Thank you.
Alright, I will.
Good. Perhaps in time new plant life will sprout from her remains that brings a healthy balance to the ecosystem.{^n}{^n}Our Matron, Malostria, will be pleased to hear this news.{^n}{^n}When the time comes and you have earned the trust of all our sisters, I am sure she will wish to speak with you personally.
Farewell.
Have you found the Undergrowth and dealt with Sylvarria?
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.

Where is Sylvarria again?
She is rooted deep underground, in an area beneath Ugdenbog known as the Undergrowth. With her ever-shifting roots, it is difficult to say exactly where in Ugdenbog you may find an entrance.{^n}{^n}Find the cavern and eradicate this aberration.
I will keep searching.
Not yet.
You have brought us the materials we need, but something festers within the swamp that not even our wards can stop.{^n}{^n}Will you assist us?
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.

What is it?
Deep beneath Ugdenbog, a vast network of caverns and roots traverses the entire region. We call it the Undergrowth. Centuries ago, a single seed sprouted roots within those caverns. It grew to become a massive creature known as Sylvarria.{^n}{^n}She has become twisted and rotten after all these years, her black roots spread out across the Undergrowth, breaching the surface and marring the land. It is only a matter of time before she reaches the coven. She must be pruned and new plant life be allowed to thrive within Ugdenbog. Find the entrance to the Undergrowth up in Ugdenbog and deal with this threat.
I will destroy Sylvarria.
Find someone else to deal with this.
I have already dealt with this aberration.
Good. Perhaps in time new plant life will sprout from her remains that brings a healthy balance to the ecosystem.{^n}{^n}Our Matron, Malostria, will be pleased to hear this news.{^n}{^n}In fact, she has been inquiring about you. You should speak to her when you get an opportunity.

Alright, I will.
Good. Perhaps in time new plant life will sprout from her remains that brings a healthy balance to the ecosystem.{^n}{^n}Our Matron, Malostria, will be pleased to hear this news.{^n}{^n}When the time comes and you have earned the trust of all our sisters, I am sure she will wish to speak with you personally.
Farewell.
We will speak later.
Do you have the materials we seek?
Yes, here they are.
Perfect, these are just what we need. You continue to be a service to the coven, for which we thank you.{^n}{^n}But though we now have the materials we require, there is a threat that not even our wards will be able to protect us from. Care to assist us?
Go on.

Not right now.
We will speak of this later.
Do you have the materials we seek?
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.

Not yet, where should I look?
All of the materials can be found around Ugdenbog. You can find Venomgaze Bile from Venomgaze Basilisks, a horn from a Leafmane Alpha and an Ugdenbloom found growing around the bog.
I will resume my search.
Not yet.
Now that you have what you came for, I was wondering if we could do more for one another?
I lost Ulgrim's Keepsake.
Must we truly waste our powers upon something as mundane as recovering your lost baggage?{^n}{^n}Do be more mindful of your possessions.
I'll be more careful this time.
What did you have in mind?
Ever since the Ugdenbog Fetish was stolen from us, our wards have weakened and some of our protective spells have even failed us. To put it simply, we are exposed out here and that makes us uncomfortable.{^n}{^n}We have plans to restore our wards, but for that we require new materials. If you are willing to assist the coven, with compensation for your efforts of course, we will require some more exotic ingredients.{^n}{^n}First, we require Venomgaze Bile, from the basilisks in Ugdenbog. Only the mature ones will do as the venom must be extra potent. Secondly, and this one may prove to be a bit of a risk, is the horn from a Leafmane Alpha. Those brutes are fiercely territorial, so be careful. Lastly, we will require a rare herb known as the Ugdenbloom. You may find it growing out in the bog, but sometimes they grow atop Ugdenbog golems.{^n}{^n}Will you do this for us?
Seems simple enough.
I'm not going to run your errands.
Will these suffice?
Yes, perfect. You continue to be a service to the coven, for which we thank you.{^n}{^n}But though we now have the materials we need, there is a threat that not even our wards will be able to protect us from. Care to assist us?
Go on.

Not right now.
Not right now.
In now forgotten times, our kind used to travel to Ugdenbog in order to perform dark bindings at the Altar of Rattosh.{^n}{^n}The altar has not seen use in decades and now lies forgotten on the northern edge of the bog. However, it is a place where the veil between realities is at its thinnest.
How will this help me?
The Altar of Rattosh is a rare place in Cairn where one can pierce the veil. I've marked Ulgrim's Keepsake with the runes of seeking. Place it upon the altar and a way into the void should be revealed.{^n}{^n}Whether you find your friend alive on the other side, or just his tainted bones, that I do not know.{^n}{^n}But the void may offer you more than just salvation for Ulgrim. Once it had served as a means of traversing great distances, though not always with predictable results. If the Cult of Ch'thon had opened rifts near Malmouth, then perhaps you can use the void as a tunnel.{^n}{^n}While I cannot promise you success, it is perhaps your only chance of bringing back Ulgrim and reaching Malmouth. Seek out the Altar of Rattosh in the northern reaches of Ugdenbog, beyond Barrowholm. I wish you luck.
I guess this is the best we've got.
This sounds insane.
You say that you no longer use this altar. Why?
That is a tale steeped in myths and legends, but I suppose we learned the hard way to steer clear of the dark promises of that altar. No sister dares approach it.{^n}{^n}You may not like what I offer, but I assure you, there is no other way.
I guess this is the best we've got.
This sounds insane.
We will speak more of this later.
You've returned. Are you ready to complete our bargain?
Here it is, as promised.
I do not know how you've done it and I do not care. All that matters is that the fetish is back in our hands.{^n}{^n}Now, for our end of the deal.
What do we do next?

We will speak of that later.
Here it is, as promised.
The fates of those thieves are inconsequential to us. All that matters is that the fetish is back in our hands.{^n}{^n}Now, for our end of the deal.
What's next?

We will speak of that later.
Here it is, as promised.
You chose to negotiate with the thieves. That is your business. All that matters is that the fetish is back in our hands.{^n}{^n}Now, for our end of the deal.
What do we do next?

We will speak of that later.
I seem to have misplaced the fetish.
Fool! Find it at once!{^n}{^n}It is more precious than you know.
Alright.
I do not sense the Ugdenbog Fetish in your presence.{^n}{^n}Why have you returned?
Where is it again?
Make your way north through Ugdenbog to Barrowholm. It is the only settlement left standing in this region.{^n}{^n}Someone living there has stolen the Ugdenbog Fetish from us, I am certain of it.{^n}{^n}Retrieve this relic for us and we shall have our bargain.
Alright.
You sounded strangely familiar with Ulgrim?
He passed through here on his way down to what remains of Burrwitch. You could say that some of our brothers and sisters remember him quite fondly.{^n}{^n}There is much more to this warrior than most people realize.
I...see.
I'm heading back out there.
What you ask will take me some time to prepare, but before I help you, there is something you must do for us.{^n}{^n}Deep within Ugdenbog, to the north of our refuge, there lies a village by the name of Barrowholm. I need you to travel there.
What does this village have to do with you?
I care not for the village, only for what was stolen.{^n}{^n}We had crafted an Ugdenbog Fetish within the swamp in order to protect ourselves from the wilderness. Recently, someone has tampered with it, tore off the head of the fetish and ran off with it.{^n}{^n}I can still sense its waning power within the bog and the only nearby settlement is Barrowholm. I do not care what you do, we must have it returned to us.{^n}{^n}Do this and I shall give you the means to find Ulgrim and perhaps even a way to Malmouth.
We have a deal.
This is not a fair bargain.
This will have to wait.
I admit, seeing an inquisitor walk in here so boldly has at least sparked my curiosity.{^n}{^n}But you must leave at once. You are making my sisters restless.
I require your aid. I've brought the heart of Carraxus in exchange.
Hah! And I'm sure you squirmed at the thought of giving it to us too.{^n}{^n}You'll be relieved to learn then that the heart of this beast has no malevolent properties.{^n}{^n}So then, what is it you want?
I must find a way to Malmouth, and...find a lost friend.
If you seek a path to Malmouth through the swamps, then I am afraid you are out of luck. The roads have all but collapsed and, even if you should somehow find your way out of the bog, the land beyond has been consumed by aetherfire.{^n}{^n}Ancient passageways exist that could take you north, but they are not of this realm and you will not like where they lead.{^n}{^n}Now, this friend of yours? What happened?
His name was Ulgrim, he was taken by the void in battle.
Ulgrim, you say?{^n}{^n}*Garradia takes Ulgrim's Keepsake*{^n}{^n}It would be a shame to lose such a...legend. But if he was claimed by the void then...hm, perhaps this gives me an idea that will solve both your predicaments.{^n}{^n}But if we are to help with this, then I must ask for something more in return.
Very well. What do you require?

Are you sure we can't talk this out?
You're lucky you still have your sanity standing here, inquisitor.{^n}{^n}Have I made myself clear?
Point taken.
Fair enough.
Welcome.{^n}{^n}We hope that you find comfort in this refuge, away from prying eyes or judgment from the uninitiated.
I require your aid. I've brought the heart of Carraxus in exchange.
I thank you for this offering. The heart of Carraxus shall cause no further harm. Instead, it now shall heal our injured.{^n}{^n}Now, what is it you need of us?
I must find a way to Malmouth, and...find a lost friend.

I require your aid.
Everybody needs something nowadays.{^n}{^n}It would seem only fair that you bring us something in return, no?
I will return.
Farewell.
Whatever it is you think you're doing here, you are in the wrong place.
Perhaps the heart of Carraxus will change your mind.
Interesting. It appears that perhaps we can be of use to each other after all.{^n}{^n}Very well, speak. What brings you to our refuge?
I must find a way to Malmouth, and...find a lost friend.

I was sent here by Inquisitor Creed.
An inquisitor? Really?{^n}{^n}I'm sorry, perhaps I did not make myself clear the first time.{^n}{^n}Leave. Now.

Are you sure we can't talk this out?

Alright, fine.
Are you sure we can't talk this out?
What could you possibly have to offer us that would make this worth our time?
I'll be back.
I'll be off then.
Whatever it is you think you're doing here, you are in the wrong place.
I'll be off then.
