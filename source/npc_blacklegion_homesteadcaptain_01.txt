Captain Somer
Don't worry about Homestead. I have things here under control.{^n}{^n}Focus on the Necropolis.

Take care.
Don't just stand there. I'm sure there's something you could be doing.
Goodbye.
What is it?
I have some questions.
Well, go on then.
So why do you hate Ulgrim so much?
Hah! That's a bit blunt, but true. Ulgrim has a bit of a history with the Black Legion.{^n}{^n}Most famously, I suppose, was the time he executed a Black Legion captain for taking no prisoners during a civilian uprising. We had no direct orders to capture the rebels, but it seemed to strike a chord with Ulgrim.{^n}{^n}The emperor was displeased with the First Blade's actions, but no formal punishment was ever deemed necessary, which did not sit well with my superiors.
I have another question.
What is the First Blade of the Emperor?
The First Blade was the emperor's personal spy and executioner, a master of the darker side of politics.{^n}{^n}All knew who Ulgrim was, but at the same time none would dare suggest that the emperor would resort to such methods.

Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Can you tell me more about the Black Legion?
What would you like to know about us?
Tell me about the Legion's history.
The Legion was founded about 450 years ago by a decree of the emperor. We were to be the empire's vanguard, the spear-tip; the ones who would bear witness to some of the empire's bloodiest conflicts. But those conflicts had tempered the Legion into the most deadly force in all the world. The title "Death's Bannermen" was not handed out lightly.{^n}{^n}Few would even dare meet us in combat. You may have heard of the Venmar rebellion. When news arrived of our imminent arrival, the rebels laid down their arms and begged for mercy. Ironically, the insurgents were then sentenced to serve in the Legion itself, where most perished under the grueling conditions we face war campaigns.{^n}{^n}That is probably one of the lesser known facts about our origins. We were not created to be some beacon of the empire's glorious army. We were a solution to the increasingly overcrowded prisons, a means to rid the empire of the undesirables. When faced with the executioner's axe or service in the Black Legion, most choose to serve and live, if just a few months longer. Of course, once politics got muddled into the mix, we began to see inconvenient political opponents, practitioners of the arcane and even some followers of the occult forced into service.{^n}{^n}This might all sound like I'm complaining, but the Legion has been good to us. Before I was conscripted, I was a worthless street rat with nothing to show for my name but a few stolen apples. Now I have a purpose, in service to our glorious emperor.

I'd like to ask about something else.
That isn't something you usually hear about the Legion.
Well, most people can't stomach the truth.{^n}{^n}It is what it is. I'm not going to pretend like we are some shining example of the pristine empire. Many in the Legion do not know the details, so I would appreciate it if you don't spread it around. It could hurt morale.

I'd like to ask about something else.
I'll keep it to myself.
That's quite a history.
Tell me about what happened in the capital.
What I remember most is the screams. Innocents being slaughtered by the thousands. Rifts opening up all over the place and spilling out fiends unlike any mankind had ever seen.{^n}{^n}It wasn't a battle. It was a massacre. Most of the imperial forces still stationed within the capital did not survive the initial attack. Many more fell while trying to flee from the doomed city.{^n}{^n}The Black Legion's Commander Tarkis stayed behind to rally a defense while we made our retreat. It was a noble sacrifice and one I will never forget.

I'd like to ask about something else.
Sounds horrible.
I'd like to ask about something else.
Actually, nevermind.
What can you tell me about Creed?
Inquisitor Creed is one of Erulan's chief exterminators of the occult and the strange. Incidentally, he was outside the capital during the fall as he was tracking down just how widespread the Aetherial corruption was.{^n}{^n}Creed has played a critical role in the Legion's activities after the Grim Dawn, coordinating assaults and providing insight on the enemy.
How does he know so much about the Aetherials?
He has it on good authority. You'll have to trust him.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
Forget it.
Nothing. Goodbye.
I've already informed Creed of your recent actions. He is most eager to speak with you.{^n}{^n}Show him what you've shown me. He needs to see this.
I will speak to Creed at once.
I will deal with this later.
Who is the inquisitor?
Inquisitor Creed is one of Erulan's chief exterminators of the occult and the strange. Incidentally, he was outside the capital during the fall as he was tracking down just how deep the Aetherial corruption ran.{^n}{^n}Creed has played a critical role in the Legion's activities after the Grim Dawn, coordinating assaults and providing insight on the enemy.
I will speak to Creed at once.
I will speak to Creed another time.
How does he know so much about the Aetherials?
He has it on good authority. Now stop it with the questions and go speak to him immediately!
I will speak to Creed.
I can't right now.
Why do you have such a grim look on your face?{^n}{^n}What happened out there?
Karroz lies dead, but I found some disturbing information on him.
Let's see it.{^n}{^n}*Captain Somer is silent as she reads through the cultist's notes*{^n}{^n}I'll be damned. If the bastards pull this off, we may as well slit our own throats. This scenario is well beyond my pay-grade. You will need to bring this to Creed's attention immediately.
The inquisitor?

Have you tracked down the target?
Where should I be looking for Karroz?
We suspect that Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon, is hiding out somewhere in one of the larger cultist camps to the north of Sorrow's Bastion.{^n}{^n}Do not underestimate him. You do not get that high in the ranks of the Cult of Ch'thon without making some disturbing deals with the devil.
I'll be careful.
Not yet.
Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon. That is the name of the cult's leader in the area. We have no idea if he is the head of the entire organization or if he is merely a pawn in someone else's game, but his name has come up several times, including a recent bloody interrogation.{^n}{^n}Karroz is hiding out somewhere north of Sorrow's Bastion, likely in one of the bigger camps. His death would surely cripple the cult's chain of command. Anything I need done is clearly beneath Ulgrim's dainty nose, so it falls to you. Will you be my assassin?
It will be done.
I won't do this.
I have already killed Karroz. I found some disturbing information on him.

I am told that Lisandra and a couple others have returned safely from captivity, all thanks to you. We thought they were as good as dead after they disappeared in Old Grove.
The cult must be stopped.
I could not agree more, and now we have a key bit of information that could help drive this conflict to a swift conclusion.
What did you learn?

Stop wasting time. The longer we wait, the more Chthonians will be at the cult's command.
Where is the Cult of Ch'thon entrenched?
You will have to venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion, to the north of Homestead, and search the cultist camps. Rescue any survivors before the Cult of Ch'thon can use them as sacrifices.
I'm on it.
I'm on it.
I was going to have you interrupt the cult's supply of sacrifices, but with Lisandra's recent return, I'm beginning to think that you can be in several places at once.{^n}{^n}Good work there. We cannot afford to have the cult summon additional reinforcements from the void. The next priority though, that's a bit tougher.
What is it?

My scouts have reported back from the lands to the north. The situation is far worse than I ever imagined. The Cult of Ch'thon is on our doorstep, and in great numbers. Worse still, they've been capturing farmers, travelers, even my own soldiers and using them for their blood rituals.{^n}{^n}We cannot risk the cult bolstering their forces with Chthonic beings. I need you to venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion to the north and search their camps. Rescue any survivors before the cultists can use them as sacrifices.
I will rescue the prisoners.
Sorry, I cannot right now.
What can I expect out there?
Terrors from the void, crazed humans hell-bent on harvesting your blood for their heathen god, unspeakable dark rituals. The Cult of Ch'thon is a despicable group of degenerates that needs to be wiped out.{^n}{^n}I would not ask this of you if I did not think you capable. Will you stop the sacrifices?
I will rescue the prisoners.
Sorry, I cannot right now.
There was much commotion reported in the area around the Gruesome Harvest, I trust you have good news?
The abomination has been destroyed.
I see your reputation is well earned. The Legion thanks you for your service to the emperor.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherial threat crippled, we can now turn our attention to the Cult of Ch'thon.
I'm eager to get started.


We will speak of this another time.
I hope I didn't make a mistake by sending you.
Where are the Aetherials?
They are in an area we are calling the Gruesome Harvest. You'll know why when you see it.{^n}{^n}You will have to go through the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands to the west of Homestead.
I'm on it.
No, you have not.
I see you've returned. Changed your mind about serving the Legion?{^n}{^n}Or would you rather sit back and enjoy some of Ulgrim's 'fine' soup?
Where do you need me?
The Legion is split on two fronts. To the north, we have the Cult of Ch'thon. Nasty bastards keen on turning all of us into a puddle of blood for their rituals. I have my best men out there right now, scouting ahead. The cultists are amassing in great numbers, and I'd like to know why.{^n}{^n}There is a more pressing issue, however, and this is where you come in. Ulgrim says that you are experienced with fighting the Aetherials. That's good. You'll need all your skills for this one. Far to the west, beyond the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands, there is an area teeming with Aetherials that we have started calling the Gruesome Harvest. It is a fitting title as the Aetherials have been gathering corpses, animal and human alike, in order to conduct their sick resurrection techniques upon them.{^n}{^n}The barn there has been giving off a blinding aether light nonstop for the last few days and nights. That is, until today. Whatever they are working on, it must be nearly finished. And knowing the Aetherials, it's something monstrous.{^n}{^n}We can't risk the Aetherials discovering that we know about their creation. I need someone to sneak in there and destroy this abomination before it even has a chance to wreck havoc upon my people. We'll only get one shot at this, so I want someone who has experience dealing with Aetherial horrors to handle this mission.{^n}{^n}Will you be my champion?
I will track down this abomination.
I am not risking my life for this.
I've already slain the abomination.
I see your reputation is well-earned. The Legion thanks you for your service to the emperor.{^n}{^n}With the Aetherial threat crippled, we can now turn our attention to the Cult of Ch'thon.



Hope the campaign goes well.
What about the Dermapterans?
Been talking to Douglass? Look, I'd love to solve all the world's problems, but unfortunately I do not have the troops to send them out on a bug hunt.{^n}{^n}Douglass and the other farmers will just have to accept it for now. Perhaps later, once the Aetherials and Chthonians have been dealt with, then I can think about sending some men out to the fields to clear out this infestation.
What did you need from me again?
Very well.
What's the Black Legion?
You are joking, right?{^n}{^n}We are the imperium's elite. The only regiment of the emperor's legions that has survived the massacre in the capital, if you could consider the losses we suffered surviving.{^n}{^n}I'd love to tell you our history, but I really have more important matters to attend to. Such as the mission I need you for. The question is, are you up to it?

Not interested in heroics.
Not interested in heroics.
I'll skip the pleasantries. Ulgrim tells me you're one tough slith and right now that's what I need most.{^n}{^n}Will you fight for the Black Legion?
Where do you need me?

What's the Black Legion?
You are joking, right?{^n}{^n}We are the imperium's elite. The only regiment of the emperor's legions that has survived the massacre in the capital, if you could consider the losses we suffered surviving.{^n}{^n}I'd love to tell you our history, but I really have more important matters to attend to. Such as the mission I need you for. The question really is, are you up to it?

Not interested in heroics.
Not interested in heroics.
I hear you've dragged Ulgrim's sorry ass out of Deadman's Gulch. Good work.{^n}{^n}Come see me later. Perhaps we can put your skills to some use.
I take it you don't like Ulgrim?
Let's just say Ulgrim and the Black Legion have a history.
I...see.
I'll think about it.
Welcome to Homestead. We could definitely use more capable hands around here.{^n}{^n}If you find yourself back out there and run into a smug smartass by the name Ulgrim, tell him he's late, as usual...
I have some questions.
What is it?
Can you open the gates?
Nobody's going through those gates until I've received Ulgrim's report.
I have another question.
Very well.
What is the situation here?
I'd tell you that I've dealt with worse, but I'd probably be lying. The situation here is pretty grim.{^n}{^n}We have Aetherials and the Cult of Ch'thon on our doorstep, and barely enough men to keep it all together.
I have another question.
Sounds rough.
What can you tell me about the Black Legion?
What's there to say that isn't widespread public knowledge. We are the imperium's elite and, sadly, the only legion to make it out of the capital that can still be considered a legion.{^n}{^n}We've suffered significant losses, but we're not done fighting yet.
I have another question.
Thank you.
Is that Inquisitor Creed?
Why, you've heard of him?{^n}{^n}Yes, Inquisitor Creed's been working closely with the Black Legion after the Grim Dawn. His insight on the Aetherials is invaluable.
I found evidence of his presence in Burrwitch.
Yes, grisly business with Warden Krieg. Creed barely escaped with his life.
I killed the Warden.
Good riddance.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
I have another question.
Thank you.
Nevermind.
Goodbye.
